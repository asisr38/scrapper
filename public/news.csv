It’s the women who are there with the hoes, struggling [...] so that they can feed their families.” In another anecdote, Speaker Mbete discussed the 1955 adoption of South Africa’s Freedom Charter, noting that “a year before, the women had already come together and adopted a Women’s Charter,” which became “their submission when the Freedom Charter was finalized and adopted.” “That document is at the base of what today is regarded as one of the best constitutions in the world,” she continued, citing it as an example of “how women, their perspectives, their unique insights and their own reality in life informs their input into what in fact becomes a critical framework for the whole society. For me, mainstreaming gender starts there.” Empowerment Following Speaker Mbete’s remarks, each of the other panelists responded briefly to various aspects of her presentation, underscoring and reaffirming key points in the context of FAO’s work: Ms Lartey on maternal and early childhood nutrition and its long-term consequences; Ms Ndisale on women’s empowerment and equal access to land and other productive resources; and Mr García y Cebolla on the value of care as a critical human activity.","30/09/2015","2015-09-30","2015","9","https://www.fao.org/gender/news/news-detail/Mainstreaming-gender-in-South-Africa-and-beyond-a-people-centered-approach-/en","10"

In many cases, this adds to existing limits women entrepreneurs face due to established gender roles and a lack of access to resources like processing technology and storage facilities, according to the report, which traces women’s participation across the industry – from catch to professional conferences to corporate board rooms. The new network will be the first mechanism of its kind to target women’s roles in research and leadership positions in the industry and will augment other FAO initiatives that support women in small-scale fisheries at the community level.","20/05/2015","2015-05-20","2015","5","https://www.fao.org/gender/news/news-detail/Angling-for-gender-equality-in-the-seafood-industry/en","10"
