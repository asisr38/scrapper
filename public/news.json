      "article_text": "FAO, NRI and AWARD present new data on the status of women in agrifood systems in sub-Saharan Africa Highlighting the impacts of Sorghum breeding in Kenya. ©AWARD In sub-Saharan Africa, approximately three out of four working women (76 percent) are employed in agrifood systems, and women make up 49 percent of the agrifood systems workforce. Within agrifood systems, women’s employment in off-farm segments – such as production, processing, distribution, consumption and packaging – is increasing across the region, rising to 29 percent in 2022 from 21 percent in 2005. These figures were presented in the overview of The Status of Women in Agrifood Systems in Sub-Saharan Africa report published by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the Natural Resources Institute of the University of Greenwich (NRI) and African Women in Agricultural Research and Development (AWARD) on 2 September 2025 during the Africa Food Systems Forum in Dakar, Senegal. The report highlights that in sub-Saharan Africa, women are recognized as carriers of culture, knowledge and social cohesion within agrifood systems. It suggests that greater investment in women’s empowerment can boost social justice and unlock inclusive growth, food security and climate resilience. Securing African women’s rights to natural resources and ecological repair are also essential for achieving gender equality, enhancing their agency and economic opportunities, and increasing their resilience to climate, environmental, health and economic shocks. While women make up almost three-quarters (73 percent) of the workforce in food processing and services, the figure drops to only 3 percent in transport, highlighting the tendency for women to be concentrated in roles closely aligned with domestic and reproductive work. Meanwhile, more than 90 percent of employed women in the region work in the informal sector. Their work remains largely under-recognized and undervalued, which limits women’s visibility and influence. “Agrifood systems across sub-Saharan Africa are powered by women’s informal, domestic and subsistence work. Investments and enabling policies are needed to create more formal wage-paying jobs for women, and social protection programmes must be expanded to safeguard women’s livelihoods,” said Abebe Haile-Gabriel, FAO’s Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative for Africa. In 28 of the 33 sub-Saharan African countries for which data on agricultural land ownership are available, men are more likely than women to own land or hold secure land rights. Systemic barriers limit women’s access to not just land, but also water and forests, which are necessary for their own and their family’s well-being and livelihoods. “Positive change already exists in sub-Saharan Africa which is directly addressing the inequalities faced by diverse women in the region– such as collective action towards women’s land rights, addressing gender based violence, and leadership in agroecological movements and natural resource governance– while there is a long way to go, these changes can improve women’s livelihoods and wellbeing, as well as ensure women’s priorities are more meaningfully represented in decision-making,” highlighted Dr Lora Forsythe, Associate Professor in Gender, Inequalities and Food Systems at NRI. The region has seen a sharp rise in the prevalence of food insecurity over the last decade. According to the most recent data, around 64 percent of the population experienced moderate or severe food insecurity in 2024, with 11.2 million more women than men being affected. Almost 40 percent of women aged 15–49 in sub-Saharan Africa are anaemic. Moreover, many women in the region face serious occupational health risks in agrifood systems, and gender-based violence is pervasive. Presenting the report in Dakar on behalf of FAO, NRI and AWARD, AWARD Director Dr Susan Kaaria emphasized that gender-transformative approaches can be effective in tackling the root causes of inequality and boosting women’s agency. “Achieving gender equality and empowering women in agrifood systems is both a moral imperative and an effective policy choice. It is key to social justice as well as unlocking inclusive growth, food security and climate resilience,” said Dr Kaaria.

      "article_text": "© FAO/Evgeniy Pechurin 28/07/2025 Bishkek – Empowering rural women is central to fulfilling the mission of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to eradicate hunger and ensure food security globally. Women play critical roles in agrifood systems as farmers, entrepreneurs, and community leaders. However, their contributions are often limited by systemic inequalities that impact their working conditions and economic opportunities. These and other issues were discussed at the FAO conference “Women in Agrifood Systems: Roles, Challenges, and Prospects,” held on 28 July in Bishkek, the capital of Kyrgyzstan. The event marked FAO's 80th anniversary and brought together representatives of Kyrgyz government agencies, the Jogorku Kenesh (Parliament), farmers, experts, and international organizations to discuss women's key role in ensuring food security and developing climate-resilient agriculture in the country. Conference participants noted that women, both in rural and urban areas, often have limited access to productive resources and opportunities compared to men, hindering their socio-economic development and reducing the productivity of agrifood systems. Overcoming this inequality is essential to unlocking the full potential of both rural women and agrifood systems. “Rural women are the backbone of agrifood systems,” said Oleg Guchgeldiyev, FAO Representative in Kyrgyzstan. “Yet they often face systemic barriers that limit their access to resources and opportunities. FAO, together with partners, is working to remove these barriers to create conditions for sustainable and inclusive rural development.” Participants discussed gender equality in agriculture, including women's access to land resources, credit, and modern technologies. The event also featured an agricultural product fair where women's organizations from across the country showcased their products. “The state recognizes the importance of supporting women in the agricultural sector,” said Asel Kenenbaeva, Deputy Minister of Water Resources, Agriculture, and Processing Industry of Kyrgyzstan. “We see how FAO projects aimed at expanding the economic opportunities of women's organizations contribute to increased productivity and agricultural sustainability. Our task is to ensure equal access to knowledge, technologies, and financing.” FAO's experience shows that equal access to resources, education, and technologies not only improves the efficiency of agrifood systems but also strengthens social cohesion in rural communities. To enhance the capacity of women's civil society organizations and create favorable conditions for their participation in strategic decision-making on climate change adaptation and peacebuilding, FAO, in collaboration with UN Women and the “Rosa Otunbayeva Initiative” Foundation, launched the project “Active Women's Civil Society Organizations Promote Peace in Kyrgyzstan” in 2023 with financial support from the UN Secretary-General's Peacebuilding Fund. Thanks to these efforts, women are not only acquiring essential skills but also gaining new economic opportunities and playing a key role in ensuring environmental sustainability. FAO strives to ensure that women farmers are prepared both to adapt to climate change and to lead mitigation efforts. “Rural women are not just workers, they are leaders who can drive positive change,” said Dinara Ashimova, member of the Jogorku Kenesh and the Committee on Agrarian Policy, Water Resources, Ecology, and Regional Development. “We need to secure their participation in strategic decision-making at local and national levels to ensure our society develops sustainably and equitably.” Participants unanimously recognized the conference as an effective platform for sharing experiences. The parties agreed to develop successful cooperative models, introduce innovative agricultural technologies designed specifically for women, and improve training programs. These steps aim to expand women's access to essential resources. Participants from the regions highlighted the issue of registering property rights in women's names. This issue is particularly important for obtaining agricultural loans and addressing other critical legal aspects of agribusiness. Ahead of the International Year of Women Farmers, which will be observed in 2026, FAO is intensifying efforts to highlight and celebrate the indispensable role of women in agriculture.

      "article_text": "29 April 2025 At a pivotal moment for global nutrition and sustainable development, FAO played an active role in the 2025 Nutrition for Growth (N4G) Summit , hosted by the Government of France in Paris on 27-28 March. Held every four years, the N4G Summit convenes leaders across governments, UN agencies, civil society, philanthropic institutions and the private sector to deliver bold political and financial commitments in support of nutrition. This year’s Summit marked a major milestone in global nutrition efforts, resulting in nearly USD 28 billion in financial pledges to close the annual USD 13 billion nutrition financing gap and accelerate progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). As of March 2025, over 400 commitments have been registered on the Nutrition Accountability Framework platform, with numbers continuing to rise – reflecting the strong momentum seen at N4G, where delegations filled the venue to capacity and leaders, including the French Prime Minister and the King of Lesotho, delivered keynote addresses. Partnering for Better Nutrition: FAO and UN Agencies Unite for N4G In the lead-up to the Summit, FAO co-led two of the six thematic working groups – on sustainable food systems and climate with the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD); and on data, evidence, innovation and AI with World Food Programme (WFP) – while actively contributing to all six. FAO also co-led the technical working group on the Summit’s vision and roadmap alongside World Health Organization (WHO), helping to shape N4G’s overall direction, objectives, and governance. FAO contributed to high-level thematic sessions on healthy diets, and the use of data, research, innovation, and AI to end malnutrition, and co-organized side events with UN partners focusing on nutrition policy and implementation. Thematic Session: “Placing Healthy Diets at the Heart of Policies and Actions for Food System Transformation” This high-level discussion highlighted the urgent need to transform food systems to ensure that healthy diets are accessible, affordable, diverse, and sustainable for all. Speakers – including representatives from governments, UN agencies, and development partners – called for nutrition to be placed at the core of development investments and food systems reform, stressing the importance of political will, targeted financing, inclusive policies, and strong partnerships. IFAD President, Alvaro Lario, underscored the central role of nutrition in achieving development goals and called for increased investment in nutrition-sensitive interventions and food systems that support diverse, healthy diets. FAO’s Director of the Food and Nutrition Division, Lynnette Neufeld, emphasized the need for a shared understanding of healthy diets, referencing the 2024 FAO-WHO joint statement: “A healthy diet is adequate in nutrients without excess, balanced in energy, diverse in foods, and moderate in unhealthy items.” Neufeld stressed the importance of system-wide action – including sustainable diversification of production, stronger value chains, and healthier food environments – to make healthy diets a reality for all.

He called for collaboration across UN agencies, governments and partners to strengthen food security, improve nutrition, build resilience and ensure women’s and girls’ rights are central to policies. “UN agencies must continue working together with governments and partners to ensure women’s and girls’ rights – and their nutritional needs – are at the centre of policies and programmes.” – Maurizio Martina, FAO Deputy Director-General Speaking on behalf of UNFPA, Leyla Sharafi stressed that women and girls, especially in vulnerable settings, must have access to the health, nutrition, autonomy and opportunities not only to survive, but to thrive. She called for robust partnerships between UN agencies, civil society and the private sector to achieve meaningful and lasting progress. The FAO-UNFPA programme, Resilient Livelihoods Development for Women and Youth , integrates reproductive health and social and economic empowerment into agricultural development. Dr Mohammad Shuaib Yacob*, Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Agrarian Reform of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (Philippines) emphasized its people-centered approach: ”The initiative we presented is more than a project – it is a movement.” Parliamentarians can play a key role in advancing nutrition, health, and equity for all by advocating for gender-responsive policies and frameworks. Hon. Neema Lugangira, Member of Parliament from Tanzania, Co-Chair of Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement Executive Committee and Founding Vice Chair of the African Food Systems Parliamentary Network (AFSPaN), underlined this, adding that by empowering women in leadership and politics, their voices can help shape more inclusive and effective policies. Pauline Verriere, Advocacy Director at Action Contre la Faim, (ACF), underscored that gender-based inequalities in agrifood systems are exacerbated in humanitarian crises, urging the use of the Right to Food Guidelines and the Voluntary Guidelines on Gender Equality and Women’s and Girls’ Empowerment in the Context of Food Security and Nutrition (2023). Emphasizing the importance of prioritizing women’s nutrition as a critical driver for sustainable development and food security, IFAD also highlighted the importance of men’s inclusion, and bringing them into the discussion on women’s empowerment and nutrition. Event Moderator and Deputy Director of FAO’s Food and Nutrition Division, Nancy Aburto, closed this final session of the N4G summit by reminding the audience that “the success of all the commitments made at N4G depends, in no small part, on the empowerment of women and girls”. Side Event: “Maximizing the Nutrition Impact of School Meal Programmes” Co-hosted by FAO, WFP, UNICEF, the UN-Nutrition Secretariat, the School Meals Coalition, and the Coalition of Action on Healthy Diets from Sustainable Food Systems for Children and All, this event focused on improving the design and implementation of school meal programmes, placing a strong emphasis on nutrition, cultural relevance and sustainability. Director of the FAO Liaison Office with the EU and Belgium, Raschad Al-Khafaji, spoke candidly about the practical challenges countries face in setting effective school meal standards, ranging from data gaps and procurement limitations to cultural considerations and enforcement capacity. FAO, in collaboration with WFP and with support from the German Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture, is addressing these gaps through a global project aimed at helping countries develop holistic, context-specific nutrition standards. These standards must be evidence-based, reflect total dietary intake, meet the needs of vulnerable groups, and account for children’s real-life food environments, including exposure to low-nutrient foods near schools. FAO and its partners remain committed to helping ensure every child has access to healthy food at school, through equity-driven, data-informed approaches. * Upon his return to the Philippines, Minister Yacob was appointed as Senior Minister of the Bangsamoro Autonomous Regional Government.

      "article_text": "©FAO / Selena Lee “If you don’t have progress, there is no pushback” – with these cautionary words, Her Excellency Bineta Diop, Special Envoy of the Chairperson of the African Union Commission on Women, Peace and Security, encouraged participants of a side event during the 69th session of the Committee on the Status of Women (CSW69) to scale up pathways towards gender equality, food security and resilient agrifood systems, highlighting the particular vulnerability of women and girls in conflict zones. Other speakers emphasized women’s right to food, based on the CFS Voluntary Guidelines on Gender Equality and Women’s and Girls’ Empowerment and the earlier Voluntary Guidelines on the Right to Food , which just celebrated their 20th anniversary. These are crucial vehicles to integrate gender-responsive strategies into policies and programming to realize the right to adequate food for all. “All people have the right to be free from hunger and malnutrition in all forms. Yet gender-based inequalities in agrifood systems continue to impede women and girls’ right to adequate and nutritious food,” said Lauren Phillips, Deputy Director for Rural Transformation and Gender Equality at the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), who moderated the event. The side event was organized during the high-level week of CSW69 on 12 March 2025 in New York by the United Nations Rome-based Agencies – FAO, WFP and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) – in collaboration with the Republic of Malawi and Nepal. In both countries, the Rome-based Agencies have been collaborating on joint programmes to accelerate economic empowerment and bring transformative change for women and their communities. Ally-Raza Qureshi, New York Office Director for the World Food Programme (WFP) explained that across the world, women and girls continue to experience higher rates of hunger and malnutrition. They make up 60% of the world's chronically malnourished population, and the gender gap in food insecurity more than doubled since the COVID-19 pandemic. On behalf of the Government of Nepal, His Excellency Nawal Kishor Sah Sudi, Minister of Women, Children and Senior Citizens, highlighted that integrating gender justice into his country’s legal frameworks and policies has proven successful in offering women and men equal opportunities to contribute to and benefit from Nepal’s food systems. The Republic of Malawi was represented by the Minister of Gender, Community Development and Social Welfare, Her Excellency Jean Sendeza. The Minister underscored Malawi’s focus on transformative strategies centred on human rights and gender equality, including gender-sensitive policies, inclusive social protection programmes, climate-resilient agriculture and cross-sectoral partnerships. A panel discussion featured the Hon. Sahar Albazar, member of parliament and Deputy Chair of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the Arab Republic of Egypt, who highlighted her country’s efforts to empower women in agrifood systems, and Jean Enriquez Rosales, Executive Director for the Coalition Against Trafficking in Women (Asia Pacific), who elaborated upon the close link between food security and protection from sexual exploitation, abuse and harassment for women. In closing, Juan Carlos Mendoza, Director of the Environment, Climate and Gender Division for IFAD, remarked: “Achieving sustainable rural transformation requires a comprehensive approach that not only enhances agricultural productivity and market access, but also emphasizes nutrition security, environmental sustainability and the equitable access to resources. This ensures that the benefits of agricultural advancements reach all members of rural communities, including women and girls.”"

      "article_text": "©FAO/Luis Sanchez In March, the UN highlighted Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5: Achieving gender equality and empowering all women and girls. FAO is committed to addressing gender disparities in agrifood systems and promoting gender equality and women's empowerment as a catalyst for resilient and inclusive rural economies and the eradication of hunger and poverty. Women perform key functions in agrifood systems, contributing significantly to agricultural production, processing and retail, off-farm agrifood system employment and natural resources management. They also shoulder a disproportionate burden of unpaid domestic and care work. Their knowledge and activities contribute significantly to food security, nutrition, rural development and safeguarding biodiversity in general. Women play a key role in agrifood systems, representing 37 percent of rural agricultural employees at a global level and 48 percent in low-income countries ( FAO, 2024 ). Yet, the full potential of women in agrifood systems remains unrealized due to persistent structural barriers, including limited access to and control over land, finance, technology, education, and economic opportunities. Their employment also tends to be more informal, insecure, and hazardous, with adverse effects on income, well-being and food security. Tackling these inequalities is essential not only to uphold women’s rights but also to unlock their capacity to drive inclusive growth, resilience, and sustainable development across agrifood systems. FAO’s pivotal 2023 flagship report on The Status of Women in Agrifood Systems provided a number of findings in this regard: It estimates that closing the gender gap in farm productivity and the wage gap in agrifood system employment could boost global GDP by nearly USD 1 trillion and reduce food insecurity for 45 million people. FAO has also produced a groundbreaking report, The unjust climate. Measuring the impacts of climate change on rural poor, women, and youth , which highlights the disproportionate impact of climate change on women and the barrier it poses towards achieving SDG 5. For example, female-headed households experience annual average income losses of 8 percent due to heat stress and 3 percent due to floods, relative to male-headed households. A 1 °C increase in long-term average temperatures is associated with a 23.6 percent reduction in farm income and a 34 percent reduction in the total incomes of female headed households, relative to male-headed households. Among the many actions FAO undertakes to advance SDG 5, the following are illustrative examples: FAO advocates for women’s equal access to and control over productive resources and services such as land, technology, finance and education. To achieve this, it provides technical support to governments and parliaments to develop gender-responsive public policies and programmes, establish sex-disaggregated statistics and implement projects that address the gender gaps in food security, nutrition, poverty and climate resilience. The FAO Policy on Gender Equality (2020-2030) provides a framework to guide FAO in addressing gender disparities in agriculture and food systems. One of FAO’s key tools, Gender-Lex , is a cross-cutting thematic database on national and international legal and policy instruments on gender equality in areas under FAO’s mandate. It helps to facilitate access to relevant policy and legal instruments and highlights national approaches to proactively address gender inequalities through sectoral legislation. Utilizing this data, FAO produces Country Gender Assessment (CGA) reports, which provide insights into gender roles and disparities in agriculture and rural economies. These reports highlight inequalities in access to resources, financial and advisory services and decent employment and their implications for the sustainable management of natural resources, food security and nutrition. They additionally offer concrete recommendations for gender-responsive policies, strategies and programmes. For gender equality and women’s empowerment to become a reality, innovative, transformative approaches for gender equality are needed to tackle the underlying social, behavioural and institutional causes of gender inequalities. These transformative approaches examine, challenge and change the structural causes of gender inequalities rooted in imbalanced power dynamics and relations between people based on their gender, inequitable social institutions and structures, as well as discriminatory legislative and policy frameworks. Through the Joint Programme on Gender Transformative Approaches for Food Security and Nutrition , FAO, IFAD and WFP worked together to embed gender transformative approaches in policy dialogues, programmes, working modalities and institutional culture. FAO Dimitra Clubs exemplify effective gender transformative interventions. They serve as safe platforms for discussion, problem-solving and collective action at community level, enabling women to become key agents of change in the development of their communities. Men, community leaders and local authorities are also engaged as crucial allies in advancing gender equality, fostering collaboration and mutual understanding within communities. The clubs typically address issues related to improving rural livelihoods and driving social change, including tackling gender-discriminatory norms and gender-based violence. Achievements include women’s recognized participation in local decision-making, shifts in gender roles, and improved household relationships. Between 2018 and 2023, FAO successfully integrated this community-led, gender-transformative approach into more than 100 initiatives across 18 countries. Over 10,000 Dimitra Clubs, involving 300,000 members, have indirectly benefited 12 million rural people. The clubs’ initiatives have contributed to improve food security and nutrition, enhanced climate resilience, strengthened social cohesion, and the empowerment of women and girls – while also challenging harmful social norms that perpetuate gender inequality. FAO facilitates inclusive agrifood systems by connecting women farmers with markets and financial institutions. A notable example is FAO’s partnership with the International Trade Centre (ITC) on the programme: “ Empowering women and boosting livelihoods through agricultural trade: Leveraging the AfCFTA (the African Continental Free Trade Area agreement) .” This initiative supports women-led micro, small and medium sized enterprises in the agrifood sector by providing trade facilitation training to enhance business readiness and competitiveness through an enabling and inclusive business and policy environment within the AfCFTA. It also pilots access-to-finance initiatives, providing them with essential business and financial skills, as well as promoting an inclusive financial landscape by working closely with financial institutions to facilitate the development of financial tools and credit schemes that reflect the assets profile, cash flow and business placement of women agripreneurs. The programme also generates evidence on the important nexus between gender equality and trade systems, as well as data on women’s trade potential along major value chains in the Africa region, including fisheries and aquaculture in Ghana, Nigeria and Senegal, and soybean to poultry in Malawi, South Africa and the Republic of Tanzania. With strong support from regional and national institutions, the programme has trained over 600 women in person and online, conducted investment-readiness bootcamps for female entrepreneurs and strategic business to business meetings connecting them with financial institutions and generated important policy advice and programmatic entry points to facilitate and support women’s agrifood trade operations in the context of the AfCFTA. While actions to enhance gender equality and women’s empowerment have increasingly been mainstreamed into development programmes and financing mechanisms that focus on agriculture and rural development, only a small fraction of programming treats gender as a fundamental issue. FAO’s 2023 report on The Status of Women in Agrifood Systems provided comprehensive evidence of the need to prioritize gender equality and women’s empowerment in agrifood systems. In response, FAO launched “ Commit to Grow Equality ” in 2024 - the first multistakeholder initiative that shifts the spotlight directly onto the role of women in agrifood systems. The initiative calls for partners to make gender equality and women’s empowerment the key objective of agrifood system interventions. The initiative aims to enhance gender equality and women’s empowerment in agrifood systems through financing and partnerships and thereby accelerate efforts to promote gender equality and women’s empowerment in the remaining five years of the 2030 Agenda. Bringing together governments, philanthropy, the private sector, the United Nations and other multilateral agencies, civil society organizations and others, the process aims to unite key stakeholders to commit investments and partnerships to make agrifood systems work better for women. As part of its commitments under this initiative, FAO has pledged to track gender-transformative actions in all of its projects and ensure they feature in 10 percent of them by 2030. Additionally, FAO will promote the dissemination and uptake of the Committee on World Food Security’s Voluntary Guidelines on Gender Equality and Women’s and Girls’ Empowerment in 10 countries by 2026- a key tool for strengthening policy frameworks. Furthermore, by 2026, FAO will launch a dedicated gender domain in its statistical database, FAOSTAT. This platform will provide open access to all available data on critical dimensions of gender equality in agrifood systems, such as women’s work, training and asset ownership, as well as data on women’s food security and nutrition. Improved data availability and accessibility will increase visibility of the existing gaps and support evidence-based actions to close them. FAO Gender"

      "article_text": "©FAO / Ben Hider As the global community marked the 30th anniversary of the adoption of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action , FAO launched the first progress report for its Commit to Grow Equality (CGE) initiative at a dynamic event in New York, encouraging stakeholders to take concrete action to accelerate gender equality and women’s empowerment in agrifood systems. The event was aimed at building awareness about the importance of women's empowerment in agrifood systems and highlighting the relevance of the CGE initiative for potential new partners. During the event, African fellowship institute AWARD spontaneously joined the initiative as its 20th partner to a round of applause from the audience. Entirely digital and interactive, the CGE progress report comes one year after the initiative was introduced by FAO. The report offers an overview of the CGE initiative and insight into some of the commitments made by partners to advance gender equality and women's empowerment in agrifood systems. Through the CGE Commitments Matrix , stakeholders can select from a number of evidence-based commitments to align with, organized by theme and grounded in findings from FAO’s report on The status of women in agrifood systems . The initiative provides a platform to create synergies between like-minded actors, raise the visibility of partners’ work, generate momentum for gender equality and women’s empowerment in agrifood systems through large scale investments and policies, and track progress against commitments made. Putting women at the center The launch event was organized by FAO and hosted by the Rockefeller Foundation in New York on the sidelines of the 69th session of the Commission on the Status of Women in March 2025. It was moderated by Amandla Ooko-Ombaka, a partner at McKinsey & Company’s Seattle office, who pointed to her firm’s research on women in the workplace which suggests that a lack of gender equality may be costing the global economy USD 28 trillion. Keynote speaker Jyoti Macwan, General Secretary for the Self-Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) from India, noted that poor women workers from the informal economy play vital roles across all stages of food systems. However, systemic challenges such as lack of formal recognition, organization and registration hinder their access to assets and opportunities. “When we are talking about a truly just and equitable agrifood system transformation, there is a need to adopt a human-centered approach, one that puts the interest of the women workers in the food system at its heart,” she said. She underscored the importance of building women-owned decentralized supply chains that generate local employment opportunities, of upskilling young women workers through needs-based approaches, and of building women’s resilience to climate shocks through awareness-raising and mitigation measures. Innovative solutions for equality Macwan also highlighted the need for innovative financing solutions – a point that resonated strongly with the subsequent panel conversation between representatives of the United Republic of Tanzania, UN Women and the AlphaMundi Foundation. Beng’I Issa, Executive Secretary at the National Economic Empowerment Council of Tanzania, covered examples of strategies that have proven successful to empower women in her country, such as agricultural cooperatives and tailored insurance policies. In discussing the persistent wage gap between women and men, Sarah Hendriks, Director for the Policy, Programme and Intergovernmental Division at UN Women, encouraged stakeholders to join in the uptake of the Voluntary Guidelines on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment . Finally, Patricia Chin-Sweeney, Senior Advisor at the AlphaMundi Foundation, emphasized blended finance solutions providing impact-linked loans to women, sharing examples from Africa. Presenting France’s first international strategic framework for its feminist foreign policy, the French Ambassador for Gender Equality, H.E. Delphine O, spoke ahead of the Nutrition for Growth Summit 2025 about her country’s commitment to closing the gender nutrition gap. During closing remarks, Sathyamurthy Mayilswamy, CEO and Managing Director for the Americas at ofi – Olam Food Ingredients, urged partners to join the CGE initiative: “Empowering women goes beyond the Sustainable Development Goal on gender equality. It can have a snowballing effect on the broader scope of sustainability, development and environmental issues.” “However, impact will not be possible without the support of our customers, NGOs and government agencies. We welcome others to join us – together, we can deliver real change,” Mr Mayilswamy concluded. Progress report 2025 The CGE progress report 2025 provides an overview of the thematic areas under which current partners have made a total of 109 commitments. These include promoting systemic change for gender equality and women’s empowerment, comprising a total of 29 commitments; closing the productivity gap (23 commitments); and enhancing women’s leadership (20 commitments). Each of the thematic areas pages offers recent data and evidence for their relevance and provides a series of partner highlights showcasing examples of individual commitments. The report also lists the newest partners who joined the initiative in 2025: the African Women Agribusiness Network, the AlphaMundi Foundation, France, the International Dairy Federation, Rise Up and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Their commitments are featured in the report and include, for instance, expanding access to funding for women agripreneurs (AlphaMundi Foundation), building a new cohort of local leaders on gender equality and agrifood policy (Rise Up) and conducting a systematic gender review by the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (United Kingdom).

This was one of five events FAO organized at CSW69, positioning women’s empowerment in agrifood systems as a cross-cutting issue to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The events emphasized the Organization’s work and commitment to empowering women, including through financing and partnerships, data and statistics, and ensuring the right to food of young women and girls during conflicts, and beyond. Commit to Grow Equality The Commit to Grow Equality event marked the one-year launch of the initiative and the release of its first progress report, featuring CGE partners and their commitments to date. The CGE initiative seeks to enhance gender equality and women’s empowerment in agrifood systems through increased financing, investments and partnerships, bringing together a wide range of diverse stakeholders. The Director of the FAO Liaison Office with the UN in New York opened the event and encouraged stakeholders to join the initiative to transform agrifood systems and ensure that they work better for women, their communities and the planet. So far, the CGE initiative has 19 partners who made over 100 commitments. The Deputy Director of the Rural Transformation and Gender Equality Division at FAO, Lauren Phillips, presented the progress report, highlighting the commitments made by partners across six different thematic areas. Women’s and Girls’ Right to Food FAO also organized, together with the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the World Food Programme (WFP), and the Governments of Malawi and Nepal, an event to raise awareness and identify pathways to accelerate progress toward fully realizing women’s and girls’ right to food in agrifood systems and beyond. Lauren Phillips moderated the event, pointing out that we must address the unique challenges faced by women and girls, who are disproportionately impacted by food insecurity and malnutrition to achieve the right to adequate and nutritious food for all. The Committee on World Food Security (CFS) voluntary guidelines on the Right to food and on gender equality and women's and girls' empowerment in the context of food security and nutrition were spotlighted during the event, as they cover critical thematic areas to address those unique challenges. The Ministers representing Malawi and Nepal commended the close collaboration with FAO, IFAD and WFP in the context of two joint programmes implemented in their respective countries to deliver transformative change, accelerate women’s economic empowerment and implement the voluntary guidelines. Conflict, Hunger and the disproportionate effects on Women and Girls On the margins of CSW69, the European Union, the Republic of Sierra Leone, the African Union, and the Global Network Against Food Crises in collaboration with FAO and WFP, brought together stakeholders to address the disproportionate impact of conflict and hunger on women and girls and discussed solutions that take into account the needs of this population specifically. At this roundtable discussion , FAO’s Deputy Director-General (DDG), Beth Bechdol, underlined the need to invest in building the ability of women to drive change, adding that responses to crises should focus not only on immediate relief but also on building women’s resilience and leadership. DDG Bechdol went on to say that women and girls need to be equipped with leadership training, literacy, and broader skills beyond agricultural production training. The roundtable discussion concluded with a strong call for enhanced collaboration and investment in empowering women and girls – essential in addressing the root causes of conflicts and both a matter of justice and a strategic economic decision. Empowering young women in agrifood systems During the second week of CSW69, FAO with the support of the Permanent Mission of the Republic of Indonesia to the UN and the Permanent Mission of Italy to the UN, organized a side event on Youth Perspectives on Empowering Young Women in Agrifood Systems through Education and Training. This side event is part of a year-long consultation process carried out by the World Food Forum (WFF) Youth Assembly , examining Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5 (Gender Equality) in connection with SDG 4 (Quality Education) and SDG 8 (Decent Work and Economic Growth). The process will culminate in a Youth Recommendations Paper outlining strategies to empower young women in agrifood systems by leveraging these SDGs. Moderating the event was Martina Borrello , FAO’s Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment Specialist. During the opening of the event, the Director of the FAO Liaison Office with the UN in New York called on all stakeholders to intensify efforts to empower young women, and youth in general, as key agents of change. Lorenzo Gentile, Operations Specialist from the FAO Office of Youth and Women, gave an overview of the year-long WFF Youth Assembly consultation process and shared key lessons learned so far, inviting all participants to contribute to this process through a call for inputs launched during the event. Lastly, Kazuki Kitaoka, the Director of the FAO Office of Youth and Women, reiterated the importance of this discussion, underscoring the urgent need to expand access to quality education and training for young women in agrifood systems. The event came to a close after a lively discussion among youth participants. Data and Statistics: Measuring women’s empowerment FAO and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) organized an event on Measuring Women's Empowerment in Large Scale Surveys. The event focused on the Women's Empowerment Metric for National Statistical Systems ( WEMNS ), a new metric for measuring women’s empowerment developed by IFPRI, Emory University and Oxford University in partnership with the World Bank. Under the umbrella of the 50x2030 Initiative to Close the Agricultural Data Gap , a project that aims to improve national agricultural surveys in low and lower-middle income countries, FAO contributed to the uptake of the metric integrating WEMNS in agricultural surveys of partner countries: Sierra Leone, Liberia and the United Republic of Tanzania. “Statisticians can contribute to women’s wellbeing by developing and promoting metrics on women’s empowerment,” explained FAO’s Statistician, Chiara Brunelli, during the event. She expanded on the integration of WEMNS in the project and discussed key findings from Sierra Leone, as an example. Learn more and watch the webcast here .

This year marks the 30th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the most widely endorsed blueprint for women's and girls' rights worldwide. Since 1995, the world has seen progress for women and girls, notably the establishment of legal reforms that protect women from violence and discrimination, an increase in women's representation in political and decision-making positions, strides towards women’s financial inclusion, and improved access to education and health facilities. However, the global prevalence of food insecurity remains consistently higher among women than among men and the world is not on track to reach any of the global nutrition targets by 2030. The Rome-based agencies come together annually for the International Women's Day event to demonstrate their joint commitment to promoting equality and women's empowerment which is crucial when it comes to tackling poverty and food insecurity, and building resilient and sustainable agrifood systems that benefit everyone. “Women play a critical role in agrifood systems, yet they face persistent barriers to accessing resources, technology and opportunities. At FAO, we strongly believe that closing these gaps is not just a matter of fairness, but an economic imperative,” said FAO Assistant Director-General and Chief Scientist ad interim, Beth Crawford. \"Women’s economic empowerment is crucial for a broad array of development goals and for ensuring their own resilience, the resilience of their communities, and more sustainable food systems,\" said Gérardine Mukeshimana, IFAD's Vice-President. \"Investing in women is not just the right thing to do; it is an essential element for improving food security, reducing poverty, and achieving prosperity in rural communities.” “Women and girls are disproportionately affected by conflict and disasters,” said Valerie Guarnieri, WFP Assistant Executive Director. “WFP works to ensure they have access to nutritious food and to build their resilience to withstand future shocks. When we invest in women and girls, we nurture families and communities. We can win the battle against hunger and malnutrition by supporting women to take the lead.” Ahead of International Women's Day on 8 March, FAO, IFAD and WFP reaffirm their commitment to empowering women and girls worldwide with the objective of building a more resilient, and sustainable future for all. FAO leads international efforts to defeat hunger and improve nutrition and food security. FAO provides policy and technical assistance to developing countries and countries in transition to modernize and improve agriculture, forestry, and fisheries practices. IFAD invests in rural people, empowering them to enhance their livelihoods and strengthen their communities. By expanding market access, building resilience and fostering inclusive rural economies, IFAD aims to transform agriculture and food systems, enabling rural populations to overcome poverty and achieve sustainable development. WFP is the world's largest humanitarian organization, saving lives in emergencies and using food assistance to build a pathway to peace, stability and prosperity for people recovering from conflict, disasters, and the impact of climate change.

The Harmoniya Initiative will serve as an aggregator, bringing together disparate initiatives, coalitions, networks, and partnerships to empower farmers, villages and rural communities. There are currently more than 90 global or regional initiatives, networks and partnerships, creating a clear need for coherence, alignment and sharing of lessons learned to deliver greater impact. Unparalleled opportunity Kaveh Zahedi, Director of FAO’s Office of Climate Change, Biodiversity and Environment, described the initiative as \"one of the most exciting being launched at COP29 , representing an unparalleled opportunity to collectively drive climate solutions through agrifood systems.” He said: “FAO looks forward to working with the COP29 Azerbaijan Presidency, future Presidencies, as well as stakeholders and partners, to accelerate the transformation towards sustainable and resilient agrifood systems.” The President of COP29, Mukhtar Babayev, opened the launch event. Other panelists included Majnoun Mammadov, Minister of Agriculture, Republic of Azerbaijan; Prosper Dodiko, Minister of Environment, Agriculture and Livestock, Burundi; Fernando Mattos Costa, Minister of Agriculture and Livestock, Uruguay; Yoichi Watanabe, Vice-Minister for International Affairs, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan; Claudia Müller, Parliamentary State Secretary to the Federal Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Germany; Paul Gulleik Larsen, Ambassador and Special Envoy, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Norway. Representatives from the Azerbaijan Rural Women’s Association, the Private Sector Mechanism, the Standing Committee on Finance, UN Women, the World Bank and the World Farmers’ Organisation (WFO) also participated. The initiative, launched at the opening of COP29’s Food, Agriculture and Water Day , will be hosted by FAO as part of the Food and Agriculture for Sustainable Transformation ( FAST ) Partnership, a multi-stakeholder platform established at COP27 in 2022 that works to strengthen the quantity and quality of climate finance in agrifood systems for the most vulnerable. Over successive COPs there has been an increasing emphasis on agriculture, with COP27 holding the first ever day dedicated to agriculture and COP28 witnessing a historic milestone with a declaration on agriculture and food Systems endorsed by 160 countries. The Harmoniya Initiative will be closely connected to the work of the FAST Partnership that counts Azerbaijan, Brazil and Egypt as co-chairs, further strengthening COP-to-COP collaboration on agrifood systems. The Initiative will work towards showcasing progress at COP30 under the Presidency of Brazil. Under the initiative there will be a portal to clarify the landscape of programs, share experiences, identify synergies and gaps, and foster collaborative efforts concentrated on the agriculture, food and water nexus. It will also catalyze investments in agrifood system transformation from both private and public sectors, building on strong collaborations with Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) and Agricultural Public Development Banks (PDBs). The initiative will empower farmers, in particular women and youth and support the development of climate-resilient villages and rural communities for adaptation action in the food, agriculture and water sectors. Evidence-based approach The focus will be on evidence-based knowledge and align with scientific best-practices, with a particular emphasis on technologies contributing to resilient and sustainable agriculture. A key aim is to enhance climate policies, creating an enabling environment for implementation, considering the diversity and complexity of agricultural systems. The Harmoniya Initiative will look for opportunities to realize diverse co-benefits from climate actions in agriculture and food systems. These include increasing farmers’ resilience and reducing the risk of loss and damage, reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and increasing GHG sinks when possible, reducing food losses and waste, conserving biodiversity and soil health and applying innovative approaches while considering national circumstances and knowledge. The initiative will also contribute with activities to build evidence and success stories for the 2026 International Year of the Woman Farmer . The impacts of climate change on agriculture are threatening food and water security for people around the globe. Climate action in agriculture has the potential to address multiple challenges across adaptation, mitigation, ensuring food security, combating land degradation and water scarcity, as well as supporting the Sustainable Development Goals. Global biodiversity, climate and land degradation neutrality goals are unattainable without agrifood systems solutions. Baku Harmoniya Climate Initiative for Farmers.

      "article_text": "Erica Adjoa Appiah (left) and Patience Kpiniong (right) at the FAO Regional Office for Africa Business Management and access-to-finance training. Photo: ©FAO When Patience Kpiniong, from the Northern Region of Ghana, first started her business, Modern Star Shea, she knew she was sitting on what she calls a “gold mine” in Ghana’s shea butter industry. But like many women in agriculture, she faced formidable challenges—chief among them, accessing finance and formal markets that could help her expand her business. Patience joined over 45 women at the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Regional Office for Africa in Accra recently for a two-day intensive training on business management and access to finance, organized by FAO in collaboration with the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) Secretariat and the International Trade Centre (ITC). The training was a boost for the women agripreneurs striving to build sustainable agri-businesses across Africa. “I hope to become an international company leading in the production of certified organic shea butter,” Patience said during a break in the training. She expressed gratitude for the “eye-opening” insights into structuring her business to attract investors. \"Coming for the trainings, it has opened our eyes to really put our books in order,” she said, reflecting on the value of record-keeping practices that align with investor expectations, a skill she emphasized as pivotal for her business’ future. Bridging gaps in agricultural trade for women In 2021, FAO launched the programme Empowering Women in Agriculture Trade (EWAT) with the ambition of ensuring the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) creates equitable opportunities for women in agriculture. With a focus an addressing gender inequalities in trade and access to financial services, the EWAT programme provided skills training, peer-to-peer learning, policy advocacy, and financing solutions to help women thrive in agrifood systems. At its core, the EWAT programme aimed to tackle pressing issues facing women in agriculture, from limited access to productive resources and capital to the lack of training and market information. With women comprising nearly 70 percent of informal traders in Sub-Saharan Africa, programmes such as EWAT are vital in helping to level the playing field for women agripreneurs. Building on the results achieved by the EWAT programme, the FAO Africa Gender Unit has continued to work to address inequalities in access to financial services for women agriprenerus in the region through mentorship, skills development and disbursement of small grants. According to Prince Oppong, FAO Agribusiness and Access to Finance specialist, this work seeks to empower women by helping them become “investment-ready”, facilitating their access to finance and equipping them with the skills to market their value proposition to customers and potential investors. “It’s been amazing,” he said of the energy from the participants, underscoring their eagerness to engage deeply with the material. Sweet success One of the many success stories from the training is that of Faustina Ankudey who works for a ‘bean-to-bar’ chocolate company, 57 Chocolates, named after Ghana’s year of independence. For Faustina, the training opened new avenues of thinking about financing. “One thing that really got my attention was...we don’t necessarily have to be only looking for investments of money, we can collaborate with new partners on better processing machines, for example,” she said. Faustina’s story reflects EWAT’s broader mission: to instill confidence in women and expand their view of what’s possible. By engaging with mentors and peers, she discovered innovative strategies to overcome obstacles and continue scaling her business despite financial constraints. Erica Adjoa Appiah co-runs an agritech business specializing in rice threshers and bio-charcoal made from threshing waste. She spoke highly of the finance training, and of her previous experience under the EWAT programme, saying that her participation has been instrumental in helping her organize her business operations and prepare for larger investments. “The mentorship aspect has been the icing on the cake for us,” she said, describing how customized support helped her navigate the complexities of her agribusiness. Francesca Distefano, Gender and Policy Expert at the FAO Regional Office for Africa and former EWAT Coordinator, added that “by helping these women succeed, the EWAT programme enriched communities, created jobs and contributed to food security”. For Francesca, the activities building on EWAT’s results have the ultimate goal of making women “viable players and agents of change” in the agrifood market within the new trade environment established by the roll out of the AfCFTA, empowering them to overcome gender inequalities that result in their financial exclusion. Francesca and Prince believe that this is a pivotal time for women in agriculture, with the AfCFTA setting the stage for unprecedented opportunities in trade which women agripreneurs in Africa can leverage on. FAO continues to drive efforts to ensure that African women agripreneurs are not only included in economic activities but are empowered to lead and innovate within their sectors. By equipping women with the skills and confidence to take on new trade opportunities, FAO reaffirms the commitment to fostering gender equality and sustainable development across Africa."

These commitments are matched against evidence-based suggestions on how to close gaps between men and women in agrifood systems, and support women’s empowerment. Commitments range from USAID, who committed to adding USD 114 million to existing efforts to tackle urgent challenges women face in agrifood and water systems, to South Sudan, who pledged to increase policy efforts to protect women’s land rights in the country. Meanwhile, the International Trade Centre plans to increase the quality of programming worth USD 300 million for gender equality and women's empowerment in agrifood systems along the reach, benefit, empower, transform framework . “In total, through our collective ambition, we will be able to reach the equivalent of 10% of women working in agrifood systems, and approximately USD 1 billion of investments will initially be aligned to the initiative,” said Lauren Phillips, Deputy Director of FAO’s Rural Transformation and Gender Equality Division. “All of these commitments are particularly meaningful because they come from a variety of actors across sectors, including governments in both the Global North and the Global South.” Commitments were announced during a high-level event, titled “Commit to Grow Equality: Investing in the Future of Women and Girls”, which took place on the sidelines of the Summit of the Future and the 79th session of the United Nations (UN) General Assembly on 24 September 2024. “We cannot claim to be championing the transformation of our food systems if we are not championing gender equality,” said H.E. Micheál Martin, Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Ireland, delivering the keynote speech at the event. He announced that Ireland would provide EUR 150 000 to FAO for its work in coordinating and managing the Commit to Grow Equality initiative and an additional EUR 1.5 million to work with FAO on women’s economic empowerment in agrifood systems in low-income countries. The latter commitment will benefit a joint programme implemented by FAO, the World Food Programme, International Fund for Agricultural Development and UN Women, all of whom made significant commitments during the event. Ministers from the Republic of Ecuador, the Kingdom of Norway and the Republic of Türkiye joined Ireland in expressing their support for the initiative and showcasing commitments and key actions being taken in each country to support women in agrifood systems. The non-governmental organization Save the Children committed to conducting a Gender and Power (GAP) Analysis across all of its agriculture and climate programs, as well as a scoping review on the intersection between climate change and gender-based violence. Private sector actor ofi aims to provide enhanced nutrition and health support to 750 000 households in the communities where it operates.

      "article_text": "Science and Innovation Forum discusses how to make cutting-edge technology available to all farmers The third edition of SIF was held under the theme Inclusive Science and Innovation for Agrifood Systems Transformation, Leaving No One Behind. ©FAO/Victor Sokolowicz Rome — The Science and Innovation Forum (SIF 2024), one of the three pillars of the World Food Forum 2024 , together with the Global Youth Forum and the Investment Forum , wrapped up three days of discussions on Friday at the Rome headquarters of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) on how to make cutting-edge technologies available to small-scale producers. The third edition of SIF was held under the theme Inclusive Science and Innovation for Agrifood Systems Transformation, Leaving No One Behind . It brought together recognised scientists, innovation experts, and policymakers, as well as small-scale producers, Indigenous Peoples, women, youth, and the private sector, in a bid to encourage a diversity of perspectives based on science. “Science, technology, and innovation are key accelerators of agrifood systems transformation, but they must be inclusive to ensure that the transition is just and equitable,” FAO Director-General QU Dongyu said in his opening address to the forum. As the world’s agrifood systems face growing challenges—including the climate crisis, biodiversity loss, resource degradation, population growth, and changing diets—the potential of new technologies should be harnessed for developing solutions. However, what is needed is to make these innovations impactful on a broader scale - so that all share the benefits equally and sustainably. The forum also aimed to facilitate inclusive debate and showcase how science and innovation can be leveraged to transform agrifood systems. In Friday’s closing session , for instance, Costa Rica’s Agricultural Minister, Victor Carvajal Porras, offered insights about the real-world impact of inclusive agrifood innovations in his country. Gene editing Thursday’s SIF 2024 opened with a session that explored the benefits of the adoption and diffusion of gene editing technologies and examined their implications, including risks, for small-scale producers. It also provided a platform to discuss regulatory and policy considerations. Research shows that this technology could enhance precision in breeding methods and contribute to the rapid development of improved plant varieties and animal breeds. Potential benefits include crops and livestock that are more resistant to pests and diseases and improved resilience to climate change. Some of the gene-edited products being developed around the world include bananas biofortified with vitamin A, hypoallergenic milk, gluten-free wheat, disease-resistance salmon, drought-tolerant grapevines, and cacao protected against fungal disease. However, there are also potential environmental, food safety, ethical, and regulatory concerns. In this regard, FAO published a report in 2022 that discusses these important aspects, followed by a 2023 report on food-safety-related issues in applying gene editing for food production, including the applicability of existing Codex Alimentarius principles and guidelines for relevant food safety assessments. Above all, there’s a need to ensure that such technologies are inclusive and benefit all food producers, including family farmers, Qu said in his opening remarks to the session. The Director-General also called for more science communication and education to better inform the public about the potential benefits of these new technologies. Artificial Intelligence The need for inclusivity was also at the heart of an afternoon session on artificial intelligence (AI), which brought together diverse perspectives and allowed participants to explore how this technology can shape the future of agrifood systems. AI is already reshaping how we grow, harvest, and distribute food, fisheries, and forestry. However, AI must be inclusive and responsible for its true potential to be realised. This is why, in February 2020, FAO, along with Microsoft, IBM, and the Holy See, was among the first signatories of the Rome Call for AI Ethics . For AI to help reduce poverty and contribute to a world without hunger, it must bridge—rather than widen—what the Director-General calls the triple divide: digital, rural, and gender. This requires proper governance and collaboration between the public and private sectors. FAO has already embedded AI and machine-learning techniques in many of its products. These include the WaPOR portal , which monitors and reports on agriculture water productivity over Africa and the Near East; the Agricultural Stress Index System , which searches satellite data for emerging signs of drought; the SEPAL system , which tracks small-scale changes in forests that can indicate fires or illegal logging; the Fall Armyworm app , which enables farmers to detect Fall Armyworm damage in a timely manner; and FAO’s Data Lab , which uses non-conventional sources and builds AI-driven tools to modernise statistical processes to support agrifood systems transformation. Reports launched SIF 2024 also saw the launch of two reports: the WFF Young Scientists Group (YSG) report, named Digital technologies for multi-dimensional youth engagement in agrifood systems transformation , and a foresight report named Shaping sustainable agrifood futures: pre-emerging and emerging technologies and innovations for impact . It also witnessed the launch of the Programme on Accelerator Mentorship for Women-led SMEs in Africa, a component of the jointly-led FAO-International Agri-Food Network ( IAFN ) initiative: Accelerator Mentorship Programme for Women-led SMEs in Africa .

Youth empowerment and cultural exchange: a path to transformation The forum will feature four thematic programmes: Youth Assembly, Youth Innovation Lab, Youth Education and Youth Culture – as well as Local Youth Action, where the WFF will launch 11 new National Chapters to reach a total of 25 that are bringing the impact of the WFF to the local level. The Youth Assembly , the WFF’s year-round platform for the systematic and structured engagement of youth in agrifood governance, will host policy sessions and roundtables addressing key thematic and regional priorities, where young people will discuss local priorities and challenges and identify actionable solutions for a better food future. The WFF Youth Innovation Lab will include hands-on competitions for students and young professionals, such as the Startup Innovation Awards , aimed at elevating young entrepreneurs creating technologies and innovations to benefit our planet, and the Transformative Research Challenge , which will focus on innovative research ideas to help transform agrifood systems. And it will also include the expansion of the WFF Youth Food Lab to new regions around the world. The WFF School Assembly, part of the Education programme, will inspire children and youth by inviting students from around the globe, both at FAO headquarters and virtually, to engage with international leaders and youth activists about the importance of good food for all. Meanwhile, the Youth Culture programme will incorporate gastronomy, art, music, and film to enhance communication across cultures, featuring events like a Film Festival and cooking demonstrations to bridge the gap between policy, youth advocacy, and actionable solutions. The ceremony featured an inspiring performance by Mpiwa, a talented artist from Zimbabwe, who captivated the audience with her powerful presence and a cultural segment with Parneet Kaur, an Indian poet and sustainability and gender equality advocate. What is 'Good food for all, for today and tomorrow'? In 2024, the WFF aims to mobilize individuals globally through diverse events, targeted investments and innovations to drive strategic changes in agrifood systems. Launched in 2021, the WFF has become a leading platform for youth engagement in agrifood issues, fostering solutions to urgent challenges. The theme \"Good food for all, for today and tomorrow\" calls for improved production, nutrition and quality of life for everyone, encouraging all ages to take part in creating a healthier planet and brighter future.

      "article_text": "Nida Collado announced as the seventh winner of the award at the 27th Session of the Committee on Forestry Nida Collado ©Keith Anthony Fabro for Mongabay Rome - Filipino community leader Nida Collado today won the 2024 Wangari Maathai Forest Champions Award for her outstanding achievements and steadfast commitment to forest conservation and restoration and improving livelihoods. The award was presented by the Collaborative Partnership on Forests (CPF), which is chaired by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), at a ceremony during the 27th Session of the Committee on Forestry (COFO) in Rome, Italy. “Ms Collado’s passion and innovative thinking have created lasting and positive change in forest management and restoration of mangroves – she is an inspiration for all of us,” said FAO Director-General QU Dongyu. Heart of a warrior for reforestation The community in San Vicente, Palawan, in the western Philippines, faces challenges such as poor reforestation seedling survival rates, poaching, illegal wildlife trading, and destructive farming practices. It is also recovering from the devastation of Typhoon Rai in December 2021. As the President of the Macatumbalen Community-Based Forest and Coastal Management Association (MBFCMA) since 2002, Nida Collado has led the association and community members in restoring and protecting their environment through innovative techniques and strong community involvement. This includes reforesting 1,450 hectares of denuded land and protecting 400 hectares of remaining forests and the community's water source. By 2009, she had successfully mobilized projects from both government and non-government organizations, further encouraging community participation. She educates farmers on the harms of slash-and-burn farming and organizes six women's groups, two youth associations, and one men's association to promote collective responsibility in forest and mangrove protection . Nida innovatively championed a technique to restore denuded mangroves. Reforested mangrove pockets, which are picked by individual villages, create interconnected pockets managed by village communities. This innovation forms a fisher-friendly pathway through the mangrove forest, blending traditional wisdom with modern conservation practices. Her dedication not only restored large tracts of forest but also empowered her community to sustainably manage and benefit from their natural resources, highlighting the far-reaching impact of community-led environmental management. “From the few believers we had when we started, to being heard at the national level, and now standing here on the global stage, this journey has been incredibly meaningful for me and those who believed in and supported me. Winning the Wangari Maathai Forest Champions Award proves that our efforts are worth cultivating and expanding,” Nida said. “When we see our forests’ rich ecosystem, the mangroves are thriving, when we still smell fresh air, enjoy swimming in clean waters, and water sources are not scarce, those are priceless rewards.” Inspired by Wangari Maathai Established by the Collaborative Partnership on Forests in 2012, the Wangari Maathai Forest Champions Award recognizes outstanding individuals for their pioneering efforts in promoting community forest management involving indigenous communities and all forest users. Previous winners are Nepalese community forestry movement leader Narayan Kaji Shrestha (2012), Mexican environmental campaigner Martha Isabel ‘Pati’ Ruiz Corzo (2014), Ugandan forestry activist Gertrude Kabusimbi Kenyangi (2015), Brazilian forestry activist Maria Margarida Ribeiro da Silva (2017), Burundian forestry activist Léonidas Nzigiyimpa (2019) and Cameroon forestry activist Cécile Ndjebet (2022). The Collaborative Partnership on Forests comprises 16 international organizations working together to promote sustainable management of all types of forests and strengthen long-term political commitment to this end.

The FAO Director-General was invited to deliver closing remarks at a session on Inequalities and Trilateral Cooperation at the G20 in Rio de Janeiro. Qu said FAO was committed to promoting inclusive economic growth by reducing inequalities - especially between urban and rural areas; richer and poorer countries; and between women and men – to ensure that people move out of hunger in a sustainable manner. The FAO Strategic Framework 2022-31 lays the groundwork for the transformation of global agrifood systems to be more efficient, more inclusive, more resilient and more sustainable, for the Four Betters: better production, better nutrition, a better environment, and a better life - leaving no one behind , he said. Such transformation comes amid evidence of strong inequalities in terms of food security and nutrition across groups based on gender, age, race or ethnic origin, Indigenous identity, disability, geographic location, and socio-economic status. The climate crisis further negatively impacts food security and nutrition inequality through a decline in agricultural productivity, reduced income, emerging food safety issues, disruptions in food distribution, lower nutrient content of crops, and changes in diet quality, among others. The recent FAO report “ The Unjust Climate ” found that in an average year, poor households lose 5 percent of their total income due to heat stress compared to better-off households, and 4.4 percent due to floods. Where inequalities are highest, the most vulnerable are less resilient and suffer the most from these shocks. “This is clearly a consequence of reduced resilience and reduced access to assets and infrastructure,” the Director-General said. Furthermore, the FAO “ State of Women in Agrifood Systems ” report concluded that women’s access to land, inputs, services, finance, and digital technology continues to lag behind men’s. Discriminatory social norms and rules affecting women and girls are at the heart of gender inequality, and are slow to change. This is why “economic growth and policies directly targeted to reduce inequalities must go hand in hand,” Qu said. FAO wants to see all actors involved work together to address the multiple structural drivers of inequalities. This includes access to finance, institutions, markets, value chains and ownership; access to and control over resources; the ability to cope with shocks; decision-making; and public participation and representation.

The event highlighted women’s diverse contributions across the tea supply chain, a context which also sees them grappling with numerous constraints including low access to credit and appropriate technology, weak extension services, limited market access and volatile prices, among others. Overcoming challenges This year’s focus provides an opportunity to reaffirm partners' commitment to supporting women in overcoming these challenges, which directly threaten their livelihoods, food security and continued participation in the tea sector. It highlights the urgent need to strengthen the prevailing business models, addressing the economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainability. During today’s ceremony, a special dedication was also made to honour women involved in the coffee sector, who share similar conditions, experiences and stories. Following the high-level session that kicked off the celebration, the FAO Director-General held an interactive dialogue with women working in the tea and coffee industries. Issues discussed included how to improve access to resources, the importance of training and education, strategies for facilitating market access, the need for greater gender diversity in leadership and representation in decision-making. The dialogue offered a platform to share testimonies from women who have overcome their diverse challenges, turning them into success stories. It also showcased best practices enabling women to contribute significantly to the growth of the tea and coffee sectors. Coffee tasting too This year’s celebration also featured a tea tasting event led by China, together with Azerbaijan, Indonesia, Kenya, Russia, and Sri Lanka. Meanwhile, a coffee tasting event led by Brazil along with Indonesia, explored a diverse selection of coffee beans. Members of the UN Women’s Guild lent their support to the events. In addition, an exhibition was organized by FAO’s Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS) programme, including a photo-video gallery focusing on five GIAHS tea sites: The Pu'er Traditional Tea Agrosystem in China, boasting the world's largest area of tea forest plantations; the traditional tea-grass system in Shizuoka, Japan, employing a farming technique known as Chagusaba, that ensures biodiversity, sustainability and the production of high-quality tea; the Fuzhou Jasmine System in China, with over 2 000 years of tradition and innovation, providing vital income for local farmers; the Anxi Tieguanyin Tea Culture System in China , where the the Tieguanyin tea tree was first discovered and where the beloved Oolong tea originates; the Traditional Hadong Tea Agrosystem in the Republic of Korea, combining traditional techniques and processing methods with a history spanning 1 200 years.

      "article_text": "FAO Director-General QU Dongyu addresses the Informal North America Regional Conference in Ottawa The Director-General thanked Canada and the United States for their ongoing support in his video address to the 8th edition of FAO's North America Regional Conference. ©FAO/Dave Chan Ottawa – The climate crisis, gender equality and innovation are three priorities that should guide the cooperation between Canada, the United States, and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) over the next two years. This was the message from FAO Director-General QU Dongyu on Tuesday as he addressed the opening of the 8th edition of the Informal North America Regional Conference (INARC), which takes place in Ottawa and is being hosted by the Canadian government. Qu began by thanking the two governments for their ongoing support since the inception of FAO, nearly 80 years ago, before expressing his gratitude for their support in the approval of a 5.6 percent increase to FAO’s regular program budget – the first such increase in 12 years. “Considering the difficult economic conditions globally, it is worth noting that your support to FAO has been historically high over the past two years. To me, this shows that confidence in FAO is being restored, and is an undeniable recognition of our important contribution to global food security,” Qu said via video link from FAO’s headquarters in Rome. The Director-General reminded the conference about his efforts to improve transparency in FAO’s governance arrangements, as well as his focus on re-creating FAO as “an agile, action-oriented fit-for-purpose Organization, capable of innovating and finding solutions to the ongoing global challenges.” Such challenges include persistently high food prices, economic slowdowns, and the climate crisis, which disproportionally affect the most vulnerable. The continuing war in Ukraine, as well as conflicts and increasing humanitarian crises – such as in Gaza, Afghanistan, Haiti, the Sudan, and Yemen - are also of “great concern.” Together with its partners, FAO is providing technical and agricultural support to bring relief, rebuild, and restore agricultural production. “FAO is committed to pursuing new innovative pathways to transform global agrifood systems to be more efficient, more inclusive, more resilient, and more sustainable,” Qu said. Its Four Betters - better production, better nutrition, a better environment and a better life - are the pillars of the FAO Strategic Framework 2022-31 and the pathway for us to ensure that no one is left behind, the Director-General said. Cooperation priorities The Informal North America Regional Conference takes place every two years. While it is not an official part of the FAO governing body process, it offers a vital opportunity for in-depth discussions with two of FAO’s most active and supportive Members. According to the Director-General, the collaboration between FAO, Canada and the United States over the next two years should focus on three key areas: Rural transformation and reduced inequalities, especially gender equality; science, innovation and technology; and climate, biodiversity and the environment. Empowering youth and women is imperative for agrifood systems transformation and sustainable rural development, Qu said. This is the reasoning behind the launch by FAO of two reports dedicated to gender equality and inclusion – “ The Status of Women in Agrifood Systems ” and “ The Unjust Climate ” – which provide new data and evidence on the need to invest in gender equality. In this context, FAO has established an Office of Youth and Women to mainstream this important work, Qu said. Innovation, together with science and technology, are seen as key accelerators to enhance effectiveness and impact and are now front and center in all of FAO’s efforts, Qu said. Finally, the idea that transformed agrifood systems can be a solution to the climate crisis is behind FAO’s Global Roadmap on Achieving SDG2 without breaching the 1.5C threshold . The roadmap provides a holistic strategy for countries to make policy decisions and innovative actions to address the issues of hunger and climate. FAO’s work is focused on supporting Members to build resilience so that especially the most vulnerable can prevent, and cope with, crises and shocks, particularly women, youth, Indigenous Peoples, and marginalized communities – all areas where Canada and the United States have been supportive, Qu said. This also includes FAO’s commitment to the One Health agenda to help, detect and respond to emerging disease threats globally. “We rely on the ongoing support from Canada and the United States to continue building these already strong and longstanding partnerships,” Qu said. “Together, as partners, we can realize the original vision of your leaders after World War II for establishing the Food and Agriculture Organization and for defining our mandate and mission for a world free from hunger and malnutrition.” FAO News and Media (+39) 06 570 53625 [email protected] Nicholas Rigillo FAO News and Media (Rome) [email protected]"

The side event aimed to highlight the critical role of financing for development in promoting gender equality and women’s empowerment as a cornerstone to prevent and mitigate food crises and transform agrifood systems. The event was moderated by Clara Mi Young Park, Senior Gender Officer at FAO. H.E. Cheikh Niang, Permanent Representative of the Republic of Senegal to the United Nations in New York, recalled the UN Secretary-General’s chair summary of the 2021 Food Systems Summit in which he called women the “backbone” of food systems. “Today,” H.E. Niang went on to say, “this backbone is bearing the full brunt of the negative impacts of climate change, of the COVID-19 pandemic and of geopolitical tensions, hindering their access to inputs. All this, added to already developed economic, social and political disparities and inequalities in many developing countries, is making their situation very challenging.” His words were echoed by the Permanent Representative of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, H.E. Olivier Maes, who emphasized the role of Luxembourg as a long-term advocate for gender equality as a prerequisite for poverty eradication and sustainable development. He spoke about financing initiatives undertaken to promote women’s empowerment and gender equality, such as the gender-focused bonds emitted by the Luxembourg Stock Exchange and the Luxembourg Green Exchange. FAO delved into the data and key findings from its ‘ Status of Women in Agrifood Systems ’ and ‘ Unjust Climate ’ reports to illustrate the lack of – and urgent need for – direct investment into gender programming from donors, governments and other actors. “Whether we’re talking about bilateral donors, multilateral donors or line ministries that are working on agriculture, there is simply not enough money going towards closing these gender gaps – despite the fact that we know that investing in women can be a ‘silver bullet’: increasing food security, increasing household incomes, increasing resilience and increasing global GDP,” noted Lauren Phillips, Deputy Director of FAO’s Rural Transformation and Gender Equality Division. Phillips also presented FAO’s ‘Commit to Grow Equality’ initiative launched two days earlier on the margins of CSW68, which encourages stakeholders to commit to significant financing and partnerships that can increase gender equality and women's empowerment in agrifood systems, and highlighted the work FAO is conducting on Financing for Development. Panelists then shared examples of successful strategies, policies and programmes in the area of gender-responsive finance for women’s empowerment, mitigation and prevention of food crises and the transformation of agrifood systems. The AfDB’s Chief Partnership Officer Cynthia Kamikazi highlighted the Bank’s strategic commitments to support the Affirmative Finance Action for Women in Africa (AFAWA) and Technologies for African Agricultural Transformation (TAAT) initiatives, while Corinne Hart, Senior Gender Advisor for Energy, Environment, and Climate at USAID, spoke about the Climate Gender Equity Fund launched at COP27, and Ndaya Beltchika, Lead Technical Specialist Gender, Targeting and Social Inclusion at IFAD, presented the Gender Transformative Mechanism in the Context of Climate Adaptation . Martha Phiri, Director of the Gender, Women and Civil Society Department at the AfDB, underscored the significant role played by agriculture in the economy of most African countries and the critical importance of bridging the financial gender gap across the continent. Delivering closing remarks, she said: “Together, we can do more. Let us reaffirm our commitment to collaboration and partnership to create a more equitable and prosperous future for African women in agriculture.”"

      "article_text": "Investing in women in agrifood systems in order to close gaps in productivity and wages is crucial to grow the global economy by $1 trillion, reduce hunger for 45 million people, and increase resilience for hundreds of millions of families. Building on these findings from its pivotal report on ‘ The Status of Women in Agrifood Systems ’, FAO has launched a powerful call to action encouraging stakeholders to commit to significant financing and partnerships that can increase gender equality and women's empowerment in agrifood systems. The call to action, titled Commit to Grow Equality , is a global process that seeks to bring together governments, philanthropy, the private sector, United Nations and multilateral agencies, civil society organizations and others in a global commitment to make agrifood systems work better for women. The launch event, hosted by the FAO Liaison Office in New York, took place with high-level speakers and participants in March 2024 on the margins of the 68th session of the Committee on the Status of Women (CSW68) at the United Nations headquarters in New York. It aligned with the CSW68 priority theme on accelerating the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls by addressing poverty and strengthening institutions and financing with a gender perspective . “Let’s pursue ambitious commitments to realize the food security and economic gains on the table if women are able to fully contribute to agrifood systems around the world,” said Jennifer Klein, Assistant to the President of the United States and Director of the White House Gender Policy Council . She expressed her country’s support for the ‘Commit to Grow Equality’ initiative and highlighted recent examples of U.S. investments and initiatives to advance gender equity and equality. Bjørg Sandkjær, Vice-Minister for International Development of Norway, welcomed the initiative, noting that “gender equality is not only the right thing to do, but the smart thing to do, and the potential is enormous”. She underscored that women’s economic and political participation is fundamental to economic growth as well as peaceful societies but can only be achieved through increased access to resources, services, technology and opportunities. Several speakers referenced the recent adoption of the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) Voluntary Guidelines on Women’s and Girls’ Empowerment in the Context of Food Security and Nutrition as an example of the critical importance of multi-stakeholder dialogue and policy convergence. The ‘Commit to Grow Equality’ initiative builds on the momentum created by Member States’ endorsement of the Voluntary Guidelines in October 2023 and the publication of FAO’s report just six months earlier. Addressing participants via video message, H.E. Nosipho Jezile, CFS Chairperson and Permanent Representative to the United Nations Agencies in Rome of the Republic of South Africa, encouraged potential partners to see FAO’s ‘Commit to Grow Equality’ initiative as a vehicle to catalyze action for gender equality and women’s empowerment, convene like-minded stakeholders, and identify synergies and entry points for development programming focused on women. “It is crucial that we join efforts to find effective ways to translate policy guidance into concrete actions that make a tangible difference in the lives of women and girls,” she urged. Maria da Conceição Dantas Moura, Undersecretary of Rural Women in Brazil, called for member states to implement the Voluntary Guidelines and to increase financing, partnerships and tools in the framework of FAO’s global commitment process. She shared successful examples from her government’s strategy to build the economic independence of rural women, promote sustainable and inclusive food production and tackle climate change. Representatives of the Netherlands, Türkiye, Ireland and the World Food Programme similarly presented their work to promote gender equality in agrifood systems and endorsed the ‘Commit to Grow Equality’ initiative. A video on transforming social norms in India under IFAD’s Gender Transformative Mechanism in the Context of Climate Adaptation was also shown. FAO is now working with core and new partners within the contours of a structured process and a matrix of proposed commitments focused on increasing financing for empowering and transformative approaches, as well as specific investment and partnerships in promising solutions, such as accelerating women’s access to land and other assets, and addressing discriminatory social norms. ‘ Commit to Grow Equality’ contributes to FAO’s Strategic Framework 2022-31 and the achievement of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, in particular Sustainable Development Goals 2 (Zero Hunger) and 5 (Gender Equality).

      "article_text": "New study shows how the effects of climate change on income and adaptation in rural areas vary with gender, wealth and age If climate change is not addressed, the gap in agricultural productivity and wages between women and men will greatly widen in the years ahead. Rome - Climate change is disproportionately affecting the incomes of rural women, people living in poverty, and older populations, as their capacity to react and adapt to extreme weather events is unequal, a new report from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) finds. The Unjust Climate report highlights a stark reality: each year in low and middle-income countries (LMICs), female heads of households in rural areas suffer significantly greater financial losses than men. On average, female-headed households lose 8 percent more of their income due to heat stress and 3 percent more due to floods compared to male-headed households. This translates to a per capita reduction of $83 due to heat stress and $35 due to floods, totalling $37 billion and $16 billion respectively across all LMICs. If the average temperatures were to increase by just 1°C, these women would face a staggering 34% greater loss in their total incomes compared to men. Considering the significant existing differences in agricultural productivity and wages between women and men, the study suggests that if not addressed, climate change will greatly widen these gaps in the years ahead. FAO analyzed socioeconomic data from over 100,000 rural households (representing more than 950 million people) across 24 LMICs. By integrating this information with 70 years of georeferenced daily precipitation and temperature data, the report examines how various climate stressors impact people's incomes, labour, and adaptation strategies, differentiating based on their wealth, gender, and age. Impacts differ not just by gender but by socioeconomic status, according to the data. Heat stress, or overexposure to high temperatures, exacerbates the income disparity between rural households classified as poor, who suffer a 5 percent greater loss ($17 per capita) than their better-off neighbours, and the figures for flooding are similar. Extreme temperatures, meanwhile, worsen child labour and increase the unpaid workload for women in poor households. ‘’Social differences based on locations, wealth, gender and age have a powerful, yet poorly understood, impact on rural peoples’ vulnerability to the impacts of the climate crisis. These findings highlight the urgent need to dedicate substantially more financial resources and policy attention to issues of inclusivity and resilience in global and national climate actions,” said FAO Director-General QU Dongyu. Indeed, barriers such as access to resources, services and employment opportunities affect rural people’s capacity to adapt to and cope with climate change. For example, discriminatory norms and policies place a disproportionate burden on women for care and domestic responsibilities, limit their rights to land, prevent them from making decisions over their labour and hamper their access to information, finance, technology and other essential services. Similarly, households led by young individuals have an easier time finding off-farm job opportunities during extreme weather conditions compared to older households. This makes their incomes less susceptible to these events. Extreme weather also compels impoverished rural households to resort to maladaptive coping strategies. These may include reducing income streams, selling off livestock, and shifting spending away from their farms. These actions, however, exacerbate their vulnerability to long-term climate changes. Taking action The report suggests that addressing these challenges requires targeted interventions to empower various rural populations to engage in climate-adaptive measures. The study finds rural people and their climate vulnerabilities are barely visible in national climate plans. In the nationally determined contributions ( NDCs ) and national adaptation plans ( NAPs ) of the 24 countries analysed in the report, only 6 percent of the 4,164 climate actions proposed mention women, 2 percent explicitly mention youths, less than 1 percent mention poor people and about 6 percent refer to farmers in rural communities. Similarly, of the total tracked climate finance in 2017/18, only 7.5 percent went towards climate change adaptation; less than 3 percent to agriculture, forestry and other land uses, or other agriculture-related investments; only 1.7 percent, amounting to roughly $10 billion, reached small-scale producers. Agricultural policies also miss the opportunity to address gender equality and women's empowerment and intersecting vulnerabilities such as climate change. An analysis of agricultural policies from 68 low- and middle-income countries done by FAO last year showed that about 80 percent of policies did not consider women and climate change. Among several policy highlights, the report calls for investing in policies and programmes that address the multidimensional climate vulnerabilities of rural people and their specific constraints, including their limited access to productive resources. It also recommends linking social protection programmes to advisory services that can encourage adaptation and compensate farmers for losers, such as cash-based social assistance programs. Gender-transformative methodologies that directly challenge discriminatory gender norms, could also tackle the entrenched discrimination that often prevents women from exercising full agency over economic decisions that impact their lives. Inclusive climate actions are embedded in FAO’s Strategy and Action Plan on Climate Change and in the FAO Strategic Framework 2022–2031 , where tackling the impact of climate change is mainstreamed in efforts to achieve the four betters: better production, better nutrition, better environment and better life for all. Similarly, FAO’s Global Roadmap for Achieving SDG 2 without breaching the 1.5 °C threshold , establishes that gender inequalities, climate actions and nutrition are simultaneous considerations, and actions must encompass these dimensions and promote inclusivity for women, youth and Indigenous Peoples. Other key report findings ●In an average year, poor households lose 4.4 percent of their total income due to floods relative to better-off households. ●Rising temperatures increase poor households’ dependency on climate-sensitive agriculture relative to that of non-poor households. A 1° C increase in average temperatures leads to a 53 percent increase in the farm incomes of poor households and a 33 percent decrease in their off-farm incomes, relative to non-poor households. ●Women plot managers are as capable as men to adopt climate-adaptive agricultural practices, but often lose more income and off-farm opportunities when exposed to extreme weather events. Each day of extreme high temperature reduces the total value of crops produced by women farmers by 3 percent relative to men. ●In an average year, households headed by young people see their total incomes increase by 3 percent due to floods, and by 6 percent because of heat stress, relative to older households. ●Heat stresses cause young rural households in low- and middle-income countries to increase their annual off-farm income by $47 billion relative to that of other households. ●Extreme temperatures push children to increase their weekly working time by 49 minutes relative to prime-aged adults, mostly in the off-farm sector, closely mirroring the increase in the work burden of women.

Such a transformation requires greater cooperation between the public and private sectors, empowering agrifood systems stakeholders, adopting holistic cross-sectoral approaches, and working together to optimize multilateral environmental agreements. This was the overarching message from the Deputy Director-General of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), Maria Helena Semedo, in a series of events organized this week in Nairobi during the sixth session of the United Nations Environment Assembly (UNEA) and the Second Quadripartite Executive Annual Meeting. On Tuesday, Semedo focused on ecosystem restoration at an award ceremony recognizing seven new World Restoration Flagships under the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration . The Decade, co-led by FAO and the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), recognizes the best or most promising examples of ecosystem restoration from around the world. Noting that the ceremony is about hope and making the possible happen, Semedo said the initiatives are \"shining examples of how to reverse ecosystem degradation by restoring, reviving, rewilding, conserving and innovating.\" The role of the private sector On Wednesday, Semedo turned to the crucial role of the private sector during a Business & Industry Major Group (BIMG) High-level dinner at UNEP's Nairobi headquarters. Part of the sixth session of the UNEA, the dinner brought together leaders from the private sector, government, UN agencies and other organizations, as well as the President of the UN General Assembly, to discuss how businesses can contribute to the theme of “Effective, inclusive and sustainable multilateral actions to tackle climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution.\" Recognizing that stronger collaboration with the private sector could help accelerate innovation and better respond to the current planetary challenges, Semedo emphasized solutions and opportunities FAO can offer to assist private sector actors in developing and prioritizing business strategies that integrate and promote sustainable agrifood practices, climate action and social responsibility principles. In their exchange, the private sector recognized the valuable cooperation with FAO to help generate better geospatial and quality data, for example on the use of fertilizers, to promote healthy soils, and curb food waste. Land degradation, climate and biodiversity On Thursday, Semedo took part in a UNEA high-level side event exploring the impact of land degradation and desertification on food security, especially in the context of the three so-called Rio Conventions (on Climate, on Desertification and on Biodiversity) – all with key Conferences over the year. Semedo noted that climate change, biodiversity loss, land degradation, and drought often occur simultaneously and usually impact the most vulnerable communities the most. In her intervention, she highlighted the role that agrifood systems can play in addressing such challenges through the climate-biodiversity-land-food-water nexus. She applauded Africa’s Great Green Wall , an ambitious transformative initiative focusing on restoring land and turning it fertile, while contributing to climate action, biodiversity conservation, food security and livelihoods. Highlighting the potential to leverage existing resolutions, codes and standards, the Deputy Director-General remarked, \"It is only through better coherence, synergies and coordination among all multilateral environmental agreements and relevant international organizations, such as FAO, that we can accelerate the implementation of the Paris Agreement and the Global Biodiversity Framework while delivering on the Sustainable Development Goals.\" Moreover, addressing the nexus can increase the impacts of scarce financial resources, thereby helping deliver on commitments on the ground, Semedo said. The Deputy Director-General also participated in a high-level meeting of the Quadripartite - FAO, United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), World Health Organization (WHO) and the World Organisation for Animal Health (WOAH) - showcasing the importance of bridging multiple mandates through an inter-sectoral approach such as One Health. The meeting discussed achievements over the past year and reaffirmed the organization’s commitment to further sustain One Health implementation at all levels with greater resource mobilization and political will. In this regard, a dinner between the Quadripartite, the current and next Presidencies of the G20 (Brazil and South Africa), the current and next Presidencies of the G7 (Italy and Canada) discussed ways to ensure that One Health remains high on the international agenda. Multilateralism Semedo's final engagement in Nairobi saw her address a UNEA leadership dialogue on environmental multilateralism on Friday. FAO already hosts and leads over a dozen multilateral instruments on issues related to the environment, pollution, plant health and food safety, such as the Commission on Genetic Resources, the International Plant Protection Convention, the Rotterdam Convention, the Codex Alimentarius, as well as normative products such as Code of Conducts on Pesticides, Fertilizers, and responsible fisheries. According to Semedo, successful environmental multilateralism calls for five key elements: Empowering agrifood systems stakeholders - including women, youth, smallholder farmers, and Indigenous Peoples; investing in actions that simultaneously address environmental issues, improve food security and nutrition and offer socio-economic equity; strengthening the dialogue between state and non-state actors to build ownership of collective actions; policy coherence at national, regional and international levels, especially in environment, agriculture, trade and fiscal policy; and financially-backed environmental agreements that generate alternatives, build country capacities and allow concerned sectors to transition to more sustainable models. Meeting with the Presidencies of the three upcoming UN COPs - Saudi Arabia on desertification, Colombia on biodiversity and Azerbaijan on climate - the Deputy Director-General underlined FAO’s support to bring food systems transformation as a common element across the three meetings.

During the COVID-19 pandemic and the “5Fs” crisis – Food, Feed, Fuel, Fertilizers and Finance – the region witnessed harrowing statistics, yet even now the region is still suffering from their protracted effects. The latest statistics indicate that the region, with 370.7 million undernourished people, continues to represent half of the global total. Similarly, the Asia and Pacific region accounts for half of the world’s severe food insecurity, with more women than men being food insecure. Indeed, rates of anaemia among women of reproductive age, are still off track in terms of World Health Assembly global nutrition targets. So too are prevalence rates on stunting, wasting and overweight among children under 5 years of age. Learn more"

The status of women in agrifood systems report, the first of its kind since 2010, goes beyond agriculture to provide a comprehensive picture of the status of women working across agrifood systems— from production to distribution and consumption. The report highlights that globally, 36 per cent of working women are employed in agrifood systems, along with 38 per cent of working men. However, women’s roles tend to be marginalized and their working conditions are likely to be worse than men’s –irregular, informal, part-time, low-skilled, or labour-intensive. Likewise, women engaged in wage employment in agriculture earn 82 cents for every dollar that men earn. Women also have less secure tenure over land, less access to credit and training, and have to work with technology designed for men. Along with discrimination, these inequalities create a 24 per cent gender gap in productivity between women and men farmers on farms of equal size. Notably, the study underscores that agrifood systems are a more important source of livelihood for women than for men in many countries. For instance, in sub-Saharan Africa 66 per cent of women’s employment is in the sector, compared with 60 per cent of men. In southern Asia, women overwhelmingly work in agrifood systems (71 per cent of women, versus 47 per cent of men), although fewer women than men are in the labour force. Learn more"

      "article_text": "Gender-based violence: a crisis within crises Within the framework of the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence (GBV) campaign, the United Nations Rome-based Agencies (RBAs) once again joined efforts to reaffirm their strong commitment to end gender-based violence and other gender inequalities, with a focus on current global crises. A very dynamic and engaging panel of speakers talked about GBV from different perspectives, proposed actions to support women’s and girls’ roles as resilience builders and agents of change, and highlighted interventions to protect them against all forms of violence. “Women are heroic in everyday life. Their power is to stay strong even in circumstances where they are not allowed to open a book or touch a pen because they are viewed as the weaker sex,” voiced Asal Latifi, a 16-year-old Afghan student, at the opening event of the campaign. Asal praised her mother Angela Ghayour for setting up a free-of-charge online school to Persian speakers who are deprived of education, an effort that has been recognized at international level. Motivated by her family’s activism, Asal – who now lives in the United Kingdom – joined her mother’s campaign for young women’s rights and education in their country of origin, Afghanistan, where adolescent girls are forbidden to attend school. “If you cannot hold a pen, you should just do it.” Asal’s “powerful words” of “strength” and “courage” conveyed a “message of female solidarity” and inspired RBA representatives, panellists and a global audience attending the virtual event, as called by Katherine Wilson, the moderator of the event. As done every year, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, the International Fund for Agricultural Development and the World Food Programme reiterated the urgent need to overcome gender discrimination and inequalities. The focus of this year event was on acknowledging that during times of crises, women and girls are often more vulnerable to food shortages and scarcity because they have less access to resources, services, institutions, decent jobs, information and decision-making power. “We saw the rates of GBV around the world rise dramatically, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic,” said Henry Swira, Director for Gender, Youth and Livelihoods at CARE USA. “The problem continues to worsen as a result of the compounding challenges of climate change, conflict, resource scarcity and increased commodity costs.” Research demonstrates clear links between increased GBV with prolonged drought, extensive food insecurity and conflict over natural resources, as illustrated by Lora Forsythe, Associate Professor in Gender, Inequalities and Food Systems at the University of Greenwich, who leads a study on these aspects in northern Nigeria. “GBV risks are apparent during the collection of food and water, which is getting worse because of the increased distances people have to walk due to the pressure on those resources, increased incidences of child marriage and harmful coping strategies such as exchanging ‘sex for food’.” In major crises like the ongoing conflict in Ukraine, which has dramatically affected the lives and livelihoods of millions of people, women can be at high risk of GBV and other effects of the conflict, such as food insecurity and malnutrition. This may significantly increase their mental burden. Speaking from war-torn Kiev, Halyna Skipalska, Director of the Ukrainian Foundation for Public Health, shared the good practices adopted by her organization for providing psychosocial assistance during the current conflict. She highlighted how crucial virtual services can be to protect women amid such crises, when internet connection is accessible: “It is important to promote online services for survivors. Many women seek care and support through mobile phone”. Panellists considered the role of discriminatory social norms as a major obstacle to achieve gender equality and women’s empowerment. Sanaz Javadi Farahzadi, Vice-President for Partnerships at the Organization of Women in International Trade, recognized the importance of supporting women’s economic empowerment through capacity development and mentorship programmes, and emphasized the need to “take a step back” to prioritize women’s basic freedoms and human rights. “How can a woman producer or entrepreneur be empowered when she cannot leave her home?” She added “We need to engage women. We also need to educate men and change their beliefs that are established based on the family and the society.” The costs of GBV beyond human suffering The global cost of violence against women is estimated to be USD 1.5 trillion or 2 percent of the global gross domestic product, according to data from UN Women, while the World Bank indicates that it can rise to almost 4 percent of GDP in some countries. “Because of the recurring climate crises and rising costs, we are entering a food crisis of unprecedented proportions with 345 million people in 82 countries facing acute food insecurity,” stressed Joyce Luma, WFP Deputy Executive Director, citing data from the WFP Global Operational Response Plan . “As of last year, there are 150 million more women who are food insecure than men globally.” Máximo Torero, FAO Chief Economist, reiterated the urgent need for crisis response mechanisms to explicitly address gender inequalities. “By impacting the health, productive capacity and wellbeing of individuals, GBV has been worsening global hunger and poverty, putting victims under life-threatening risks, and leading to massive costs to individuals, families, communities and beyond”. Morten Aasland, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Norway to the United Nations organizations based in Rome, called for actions that effectively encompass women’s concerns in times of compounded hardships. “When the global community mobilizes against the climate and food crises, we should demand and ensure that they specifically address also the situation of women, and that they result in recommendations and actions that seriously consider women's situation”. “We need sustained commitment 365 days of the year and we need resources allocated to match the level of our solidarity statements and tweets on this day,” pointed out Guoqi Wu, IFAD Associate Vice-President and Gender Champion, in his closing remarks. “Only when women flourish, families and communities do too.”"

Her family members were herders, but years of great drought chased them off the land and towards Nouakchott, the capital, like many others. It was only after she became a schoolteacher and was posted back to her hometown, Kiffa, that she reconnected with her roots. There, she married into an agropastoral family, which revived her passion for herding and raising livestock, a sector traditionally dominated by men. Today, Zeinabou is part of several pastoral associations, where she makes a particular effort to get more women involved in the old nomadic way of life. Together with other women herders, Zeinabou set up a transformation unit for dairy products on the outskirts of the city, where they collect milk from pastoralists and transforms it into yoghurt and other long-life products.

      "article_text": "Receiving the capital she needed from the Joint Sustainable Development Goals Fund, Nila Ríos established a chicken farm that helps her to support her family. ©FAO/Gerard Vargas Fernández of Moove Agency Her house was quiet when suddenly Petronila Ríos heard a sharp beep. A message appeared on her phone: Nila, I need four fresh chickens for today. Nila, as she is known by her community, smiled. Her updated status on social networks had paid off: customers had started placing their orders for the day. Just a few years before, Nila had begun her business of selling chickens in the Indigenous Peoples’ territory of China Kichá in southern Costa Rica, where a part of the Cabécar people have lived for more than 3 000 years. This land has been at the heart of their culture and language, and they have preserved it carefully, maintaining a strong and reverential relationship with nature. Proud of her land and community, Nila has always looked for new ways to contribute to its development. An opportunity arose when FAO, the United Nations Development Program, the International Labor Organization and UN Women implemented a joint programme called Strengthening the bridge to development strategy to break the cycle of poverty at the local level with a gender and environmental approach in her area. Nila worked hard to get involved in the programme and obtain the capital that allowed her to start a chicken farm. This support through the Joint Sustainable Development Goals Fund set Nila off with 25 chickens and four months later, she had quadrupled her stock. “I feel fulfilled because I can save up and contribute financially to my household. This empowers you,” Nila explained. “Now the community benefits from this food and so does my family,” she continues, recalling the start of her business with a sparkle in her eyes. And Nila is not the only one. The China Kichá Women's Association, made up of ten Cabécar women, also applied for funds for projects involving pigs, chickens, corn, beans and bananas. As part of this programme that aims to promote gender equality and environmentally sound practices, FAO provided training and technical assistance to Nila and many others in her community to boost their businesses. FAO provided training, seed capital and technical assistance to Nila and many other Cabécar people in China Kichá, Costa Rica. ©FAO/ Gerard Vargas Fernández of Moove Agency Recovering land From Nila’s home region of China Kichá, it is approximately six kilometers to the nearest restaurant or shop. This fact gave Nila and her family the idea to expand her business and open a local restaurant. But developing this new venture would not be easy. As an Indigenous Peoples from the territory of China Kichá, the Cabécar people have lived through many periods of struggle. Since the colonial period, they have faced major conflicts over owning land and exercising governance in their lands, territories and resources, facing abuse, discrimination and putting their lives at risk to ensure their rights. Nila's sister, Doris Ríos, is a defender of Indigenous Peoples’ rights. According to her, in the last three years of activism and fighting for their rights, members of the Cabécar people have recovered up to 60 percent of their land in China Kichá. This has allowed them to have their own plots to plant and generate foods for more diversified diets, preserving their ancestral food systems and knowledge of the land. “For Indigenous Peoples, it is key to recover the land and regenerate the soils. We have seen damage to the land, and we have worked on reconversion processes with organic agriculture,” said Doris Ríos, regarding her collaboration with FAO. In fact, this was part of what they learned with the joint programme: to enhance their own practices and produce better by combining Indigenous Peoples’ knowledge together with new techniques to take care of the soil. According to William Hernández, Nila’s husband, land ownership has been key to further developing the community's economy. “Land is needed to plant and ensure the subsistence for our people. This has been an awakening. Now, we can cultivate more because before there was no space or land to do it in. We didn't even have the right to dream,” Hernández said. As Indigenous Peoples, the Cabécar have lived through many periods of struggle over land ownership and governance. However, in the last three years, the fight for their rights has paid off and they have recovered up to 60 percent of their land in China Kichá. ©FAO/ Gerard Vargas Fernández of Moove Agency For Nila, the projects that she has managed to develop have been like drops of water that fell on fertile soil. With the support of the FAO and the Costa Rican government, Nila’s projects have germinated into seeds of change, opening new opportunities for her family and community to manage their ancestral land and find even more ways to produce better for their food security and the environment.

      "article_text": "Twelve rural women from the Caribbean Network of Rural Women Producers (CANROP) membership including Antigua and Barbuda, The Bahamas, Barbados, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago are now better equipped with soft skills such as conflict management and effective communication strategies. These new skills are a result of a joint five-day training workshop between the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and CANROP held in Panama from 11 to 15 July 2022, implemented under the Programme Farmers Organizations for ACP (FO4ACP). The aim of the Training Workshop was to empower farmers and their organizations by focusing on strengthening the women’s ability to work together at the regional level and in their national groups. The training comprised of 16 sessions and was facilitated by CANROP Members, who received a two-month long training course to prepare them for their facilitator role. The contents of the sessions were both people-focused and process-focused and the discussions focused on tools and strategies to identify and build strong leadership, working together to reach consensus based on a shared vision, and to effectively manage conflict in complex organizational environments. Carmen Nurse, CANROP President stated that, “This workshop has provided a roadmap on how we, the executive members, can improve our present management structure and guidance of the farmers and organizations. We have received the keys for governance using the ‘social capital theory’, which is people working together as groups. While the bonding relationships presently exist among the chapter members, at the executive level we now need to focus more on bridging the gaps among chapters and network with external entities with the goal of creating a CANROP brand for groups, services and products. Together with our external partners we will make it happen”. Hedda Rose-Dunkley, a course facilitator from Jamaica said that, “The concept of bonding bridging and linking came out in the 5 days. Members were able to share practical experiences/ exchanges and this augured well for the sessions delivered. The concepts were clear on day four and the importance of partnerships and networking was highlighted as a feature for farming organizations to thrive”. Meanwhile, Frances Redhead, a participant from Grenada stated that, “This training is essential for the building of the national and regional agrifood systems in order to better enhance the efforts of women in meeting food security mandates for our countries”. Pedro Boareto, FAO Project Coordinator highlighted the importance of the training and explained that the methodology used in the sessions supports the farmers and their organizations to acquire knowledge and tools to implement learning activities for building three types of relations, i.e. bonding, bridging, and linking, which are core relations for an organizational development process of farmer organizations."

There is evidence that the underlying drivers of the increase in hunger witnessed over recent years – conflict, climate shocks and economic downturns – have hit women harder than men. The food security gender gap grew even larger during the year in which the COVID-19 pandemic spread across the world, with the prevalence of moderate or severe food insecurity 10% higher among women than men in 2020, compared to 6% in 2019. The Director-General also noted that women comprise nearly half of the rural workforce in low-income countries. Yet “everywhere, rural women face gender-based constraints that limit their potential,” Qu said. “We must act now to transform our agrifood systems for better production, better nutrition, a better environment, and a better life for all, leaving no one behind.

The first training session of the series focused on ‘Connecting the dots between Gender Equality, Women's Representation and Advocacy’. It was run by Ilaria Sisto, FAO Gender and Climate Change Expert, and Maurizio Furst, FAO Gender Specialist, who were joined by nearly 20 participants from diverse countries, regions and organisations. The training was a chance to learn and discuss some key concepts, including gender-responsive climate justice, climate change negotiations, advocacy and policy dialogue. In his presentation, Maurizio Furst covered the basics of gender and sex, the unique challenges facing women, and the gender-responsive and gender-transformative approaches to tackle them. Ilaria Sisto’s presentation then linked gender equality and climate change. She highlighted the positive benefits that gender equality has on the economy, before showing how climate change disproportionately affects women. She gave some pointers for the achievement of gender equality, including advocating at national policy dialogues, strengthening capacities for the collection of sex-disaggregated data and designing gender-responsive interventions. Participants joined the training with a wide range of backgrounds and interests. Angela Nyanchama Nyamongo, from Kenya, took part to “learn more about tools that can be used to advocate for women's rights for gender equality”, whilst Joann Ofori, from Ghana, hoped to “learn more about tools that can be used to advocate for women's rights for gender equality.” “The global pandemic has taught us that individual and national solutions to global challenges such as climate change does not work.

Priority areas The training concluded with a mapping exercise, allowing WeCaN participants to share the priority areas for action in their region. In smaller groups, members shared challenges that faced women in their own countries, as well as some best practices and solutions currently being implemented to meet them. The main challenges across the regions were women’s access to land, patriarchal inheritance laws for land that disadvantage women, and a lack of representation in decision making processes.

      "article_text": "31 March 2022 EU-STREIT PNG Programme rolls out training workshops for youths and women on road works and maintenance skills in the Sepik Region to strengthen local skilled labour capacity for professional and quality transport infrastructure maintenance, rehabilitation and construction. Wewak, Papua New Guinea – EU Funded UN Joint STREIT PNG Programme, as part of its mission to strengthen local capacity for quality transport infrastructure works in Sepik Region, organised a skill training and capacity development course for 30 youths and women, pulled from different parts of East Sepik Province, on construction of stone masonry and gabion retaining structure that are critical for professional and quality construction works. Led by the International Labour Organization (ILO) in partnership with by the Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Centre in Wewak, the training aims to promote decent work employment for rural youth and women who lack in-demand practical qualifications in the area. The knowledge and skills taught during this course also help the trainees to qualify as skilled manpower, which in turn strengthens the locally available skilled labour capacity to support the road construction and development sector in the region. This partnership in co-organising the training also serves as a capacity development vehicle to further strengthen and enable TVET to design, develop and implement enhanced skill development services to the community members, securing the sustainability of the Programme’s support interventions when the EU-STREIT PNG concludes its activities in the Region. In attendance were nine young women participants who were looking forward to learn as much as they can from this seven-days intensive training module that concluded on 29 March 2022. Construction of stone masonry and gabion retaining structures with a particular focus on foundation of structures, dressing, bond stone, insertion of chips, joints, mortar, weep holes, pointing and plastering, assembling of gabion, placing, filling with stones, lacing and bracing, test and acceptance were amongst the main topics covered during this training. Officiating the training, the EU-STREIT PNG Programme Coordinator, Dr Xuebing Sun, highlighted how this training is practical and fits the professional construction market’s skill demands in the area. “By looking at the training curriculum and training structure, I think this training is being well designed. It is a very practical vocational training and some awareness promotion elements for Gender and Youth Inclusion,” adding “we need to learn from this kind of training to further transform our young people including girls and women who play equally important roles to meet the needs of our people.” “These knowledge and skills will prepare these young trainees to qualify as skilled manpower with the capacity to support road rehabilitation, maintenance and development sector in the Sepik Region,” Dr Sun further added. Also present at the opening held at the Yawasoro facility was TVET Wewak Principal Mr Tom Yalingen and Director for Provincial Works and Technical Services Mr James Baloiloi, who were pleased to see the active participation of youth and women trainees as well. “We think construction work is for men only. I think any kind of work women put their hands on is neat and of quality and this is a challenge to us, the men folks,” said a delighted Mr Baloiloi. For two female trainees, they were waiting to pay their way back to their studies and this training was an opportunity they couldn’t miss. Odilah Willie of Banak Village in Wewak District said: “I was not able to complete my year 12 studies because of school fee problems and I see this as a good chance for me.” While Damaris Finaka of Yangoru-Saussia District added: “I’m happy to become a role model for other girls to see and follow with the belief that road works is not a job for men only.” Damaris is looking forward to complete her Diploma Studies at the University of Papua New Guinea. This ILO-led training was also an opportunity for other graduate participants to build on their competencies and plan to impart their newly acquired knowledge and skills to villager fellows. One was Job Yawi, an enthusiast participant who had completed grade 12 studies and had been in the village for 10 years. “I want to say thank you to this programme to attend this course. I will go and train others as well in the village.” The participants are mostly grade 10- and 12-leavers who missed out on opportunities to further their studies. They were selected from 89 applicants who applied from all districts of East Sepik Province. “This kind of practical training will transfer the skills to young people that will help them to link in the job market for better-paid employment in future,” said Mr. Shailendra Kumar Jha, Chief Technical Advisor of ILO EU-STREIT PNG. Additionally, “the TVET centre will be able to organise similar training with the training materials developed with support from ILO,” said Mr. Arun Kumar Yadav, ILO’s International Training Engineer for E- STREIT PNG. The training is the first of five batches to be conducted this year for a target of 150 trainees from East Sepik and Sandaun provinces. The EU-STREIT PNG, is implemented as a UN joint Programme (FAO as leading agency, and ILO, ITU, UNCDF and UNDP as partners). It is the largest grant-funded Programme of the European Union in the country and the Pacific region. The Programme aims to help improve the lives of the people from East Sepik and Sandaun province, by focusing on increasing sustainable and inclusive economic development of rural areas through improved economic returns and opportunities from cocoa, vanilla and fishery value chains while strengthening and improving the efficiency of value chain enablers, including the business environment, and supporting sustainable, climate-proof transport and energy infrastructure development.

      "article_text": "In a bid to organize women in fisheries, strengthen their position and enhance their participation in fisheries and aquaculture, the Government of Malawi in collaboration with the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and development partners supported the launch of the Malawi chapter of the African Women in Fisheries and Aquaculture Network (AWFISHNET). A lack of organizational capacity, good governance systems and sufficient capital and appropriate technology to meet market standards and demands, are some of the constraints that limit women in fisheries from economic empowerment. Given these challenges, the ability to organize and form a network is particularly important as it will promote collective marketing, offering opportunities for women to negotiate for competitive prices and will also bring greater visibility to women’s role within the sector. “We expect that this network will contribute to enhancing the economic empowerment of women in fisheries and aquaculture, which is not only a social justice issue, but also important for sustainable economic growth within the fisheries sector,’’ said FAO Representative, Zhijun Chen. Among its key functions, the AWFISHNET Malawi chapter will enhance connections among women in the sector by enabling them to communicate and collaborate with each other, provide a platform for women fish processors, traders and fish farmers to share best practices, experiences, technologies and learn together. \"Establishment of this network will increase the visibility of women’s work and enable better understanding and recognition of the important role that they play in the sector. This network for women fishers in Malawi is a milestone for the country, seeing as women play a critical role along the fisheries value chain in utilizing fisheries resources not only for economic gains, but also for nutritional and food security goals,” Minister of Natural Resources and Climate Change, Eisenhower Nduwa Mkaka. A platform for advocacy and change The network will also be a platform for call for action on issues affecting women and for facilitating policy to create an enabling environment that enhances their role in the fisheries and aquaculture sub-sectors. “The Malawi chapter of AWFISHNET is a critical platform that will promote local initiatives of women fishers. Through this network, the capacities of women fishers will be enhanced with knowledge and skills to lobby and advocate by themselves with decision makers at national level,’’ said Violet Kanyamula, who is the interim chairperson for the network. Over 80 percent of fish traders in Malawi are women. They are involved in processing, transporting and selling of fish in wholesale markets, work that is usually constrained by high transportation costs, post-harvest losses, unfair market practices by middle-men and a lack of modern, gender-sensitive technologies. In this context, the establishment of AWFISHNET Malawi is in line with the Voluntary Guidelines for Securing Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries (SSF Guidelines), which recognize the importance of organizing women in fisheries. The SSF Guidelines is the only internationally negotiated instrument dedicated to small scale fisheries. In Malawi, it is being implemented with support from the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD). About AWFISHNET The African Women Fish Processors and Traders Network (AWFISHNET) is a membership network of women fish processors and traders in Africa. The network membership is drawn from national associations of women involved in the fisheries sector, from 32 African Union countries. As such, the network is also meant to strengthen women’s role as small and medium enterprises (SMEs), helping to expand their business and marketing opportunities. The launch of the AWFISHNET Malawi Chapter comes during the United Nations International Year of Artisanal Fisheries and Aquaculture (IYAFA 2022), which aims to highlight the importance of small-scale artisanal fisheries and aquaculture for global food systems, livelihoods, culture and the environment. The AWFISHNET launch had an attendance of 50 participants representing stakeholders from the Southern African Development Community (SADC), partners such as the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), and women participating in small-scale fisheries."

The EU-RBA Joint Programme on Gender Transformative Approaches for Food Security and Nutrition (JP GTA) Since 2019, the United Nations Rome-based Agencies (RBAs) – FAO, IFAD and WFP – in collaboration with and through the financial support of the European Union, have been implementing the JP GTA. In 2020, the JP GTA developed a Theory of Change for gender transformative programming based on the hypothesis that SDG 2 – zero hunger – will only be achieved if interventions to eliminate hunger also address the root causes of gender inequalities and trigger transformative change towards gender equality and women’s empowerment at individual, household, community, institution and policy levels.",
      "article_text": "Blog post by: Hajnalka Petrics, Global Coordinator, JP GTA What if your diet was lacking proteins – because fish and eggs are considered fit for men, but not for women? What if you were deprived of your source of food and income – because the law allows land to be owned by men, but not by women? What if you had to fear for your life when a flood hits – because boys get taught to swim, but not girls? The causes of gender inequalities across all spheres of life – in families, communities and institutions – are often deep-rooted. They lie in restrictive gender norms that dictate what is considered acceptable for women and girls, but also for men and boys, to do, eat, learn, work. They are found in unbalanced power dynamics and social relations that determine what role women should play vis-à-vis their male counterparts. And they reside in inequitable institutions and discriminatory legislative frameworks or customary practices that prevent women from realizing their full potential. When looking to achieve gender equality and improve the lives of all, particularly women and girls, it is not enough to tackle the symptoms of inequality – such as unequal nutrition, income or skills. It is essential to look deeper to understand and challenge the underlying causes, without which change can be limited or short-lasting. Increasingly, development practitioners are therefore resorting to gender transformative approaches and methodologies to address the underlying causes of inequality and achieve equitable and sustainable outcomes. Good practices of gender transformative approaches Gender transformative approaches have the potential to make the difference needed to create a more equitable, sustainable world for women and men, girls and boys. There are many methodologies that can be applied in different contexts to achieve transformational change. An overview of 15 good practices can be found in the Compendium developed by the Joint Programme on Gender Transformative Approaches for Food Security and Nutrition (JP GTA). The Compendium includes examples such as individual household mentoring applied by IFAD, the Community Conversations methodology implemented by WFP, and many more. For instance, FAO’s Dimitra Clubs helped communities in the Tshopo Province of the Democratic Republic of Congo overcome a long-established taboo that barred women from fishing activities and from eating many protein-rich foods. Bringing members of the community together for discussion groups, Dimitra Clubs managed to gradually shift attitudes and behaviours. Women are now able to carry out tasks that were previously acceptable only for men and allowed to eat foods that were previously banned. The redefinition of women’s roles has resulted in higher incomes, improved nutrition and new skills. The Journeys of Transformation method used by Promundo proactively engages men whose partners participate in women’s economic empowerment interventions. It was inspired by research that showed how conflict within couples may increase as women earn more and that, even as women generate more income, they continue to do the majority of unpaid care work. Piloted in Rwanda, the curriculum offers group education activities for men, focusing on business and negotiation skills, couples’ decision-making processes, health and wellbeing, and gender-based violence. The program also stimulates community discussions to promote changes in norms related to gender. Meanwhile, based upon the premise that strong organizations facilitate joint action towards social and economic empowerment, poverty alleviation, wealth creation and well-being, the Toolbox for Gender Mainstreaming in Member-based Organizations , developed by Trias in Central America, aims to institutionalize gender equity. It enables member-based organizations and NGOs to become more sustainable by improving their inclusivity and gender equality, while simultaneously working on individual empowerment and building alliances between women and men. This integrated approach promotes in-depth change that is embedded at the institutional level. The EU-RBA Joint Programme on Gender Transformative Approaches for Food Security and Nutrition (JP GTA) Since 2019, the United Nations Rome-based Agencies (RBAs) – FAO, IFAD and WFP – in collaboration with and through the financial support of the European Union, have been implementing the JP GTA. Within the framework of the Programme, the three Agencies and the EU are working to address the underlying causes of gender inequality by embedding gender transformative approaches in policy dialogues, programmes, working modalities and institutional culture. The JP GTA also works to develop knowledge products, conduct training activities and engage at the institutional level within the RBAs as well as EU and partner organizations to enhance awareness and capacities around gender transformative approaches. In doing so, the JP GTA seeks to contribute to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 2 to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. In 2020, the JP GTA developed a Theory of Change for gender transformative programming based on the hypothesis that SDG 2 – zero hunger – will only be achieved if interventions to eliminate hunger also address the root causes of gender inequalities and trigger transformative change towards gender equality and women’s empowerment at individual, household, community, institution and policy levels. The Theory of Change is now being field tested in two pilot countries, Ecuador and Malawi . In Ecuador, the focus is on reducing the barriers rural women face in family farming and across the agrifood value chain. It is doing so by tackling constraining gender norms and strengthening rural women’s productive capacities, their access to economic and technical resources, services and markets, and their decision-making positions in local organizations. In Malawi, the Programme seeks to enhance the economic autonomy of women and youth through improved financial inclusion, working with governmental institutions and regulatory bodies, Village Savings and Loan Associations (VSLAs), financial institutions, and rural households and communities. Based on the findings from these country-level activities, the Theory of Change will be revised to reflect what worked in these contexts and adapted to guide future gender transformative programming. In addition, the Joint Programme is collaborating with the CGIAR GENDER Platform to develop a guide on measuring gender transformative change that the RBAs, the EU, the CGIAR and other partners can adopt – and adapt as needed – in their work. This article was first published as part of the GFAR Partners in Action series. Each month, the series showcases stories related to a key theme in agri-food research and innovation. The theme for March 2022 is ‘Creating Change: Gender Transformative Approaches in Agriculture’. Image: © FAO Ecuador Contacts:"

The programme which began in 2014 seeks to expand its funding base and further scale up to additional countries. This new five-year phase of the programme will initially focus on Nepal, Niger, the Pacific Islands, Tanzania and Tunisia, thanks to the generous support of Norway and Sweden who have committed approximately $25 million towards the programme. “This partnership builds on previous success and demonstrates the impact of combining expertise to achieve significant results for rural women. These results include increased agricultural productivity, economic autonomy, and leadership roles. We are grateful to Norway and Sweden for the opportunity to scale up the programme in both existing and new countries, keeping the rights and needs of rural women firmly at the centre,” said Sima Bahous, UN Women, Executive Director. Rural women face structural barriers including discriminatory policies, legislation and social norms which hinder their access to services, resources and opportunities. They carry the disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work and are often excluded from participation and leadership in rural public life. “This programme and its holistic approach is a great vehicle to improve rural women’s livelihoods. Lessons learned from the first phase show that it is crucial to secure funding from the onset of the programme and we encourage other donors to join us in this important effort to empower rural women,” said Astrid T. Tveteraas, Head of Section for Food, Department for Climate and Environment, Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation. “This programme has shown that rural women are key agents for achieving the transformational economic, environmental and social changes required for sustainable development. Sweden is pleased to support the second phase in new countries. Equally, Sweden is eager to support how approaches and lessons from the programme can push the overall global development of women’s economic empowerment further,” said Lotta Sylwander, Lead Policy Specialist Gender, Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency. The programme builds on the comparative advantages and strengths of FAO, IFAD, UN Women and WFP to address the multi-faceted dimensions of rural women’s economic empowerment, which includes access to opportunities, resources and services, including land, credit, and technology. The programme works with national governments to advance policy change, with local government to ensure policy implementation, and with local communities and households to tackle unequal power dynamics and discriminatory social norms in order to achieve deep rooted and lasting change. The first phase of the programme was implemented in Ethiopia, Guatemala, Kyrgyzstan, Liberia, Nepal, Niger and Rwanda from 2014 to 2021 and reached approximately 80 000 rural women. The participants achieved, on average, an 82 percent increase in agricultural production, generated over $3 600 000 from on-farm and off-farm sales and almost $2 million through savings and loan schemes. Programme results also showed greater economic autonomy for rural women, more gender equitable household relations and increased numbers of women in leadership positions. The new phase of the Programme will be formally launched at a side event during the 66th Session on the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) on 23 March 2022.

      "article_text": "Celebrating the contributions of rural and indigenous women to healthy food systems and a sustainable tomorrow Around a third of the world’s food is produced by smallholder farmers on less than two hectares of land . In Sub-Saharan Africa, the percentage is much larger, with some 60 percent of the population engaged as smallholder farmers in food production and processing. At least half of these farmers are women, who specialise in seeding, weeding, transplanting, harvesting, post-harvest work, processing, marketing and, in some areas, land preparation. This year’s International Women’s Day recognized the contributions of women and girl leaders and change-makers around the world who are fighting for sustainability in the face of the ongoing climate crisis. Despite their crucial role in agrifood systems, women are faced with enormous challenges, including exclusion from decision-making, denial of essential productive resources such as land, water, credit, information, and technologies, and disregard for their deep knowledge of local contexts. In addition, they are disproportionately affected by climate and weather-related disasters, constituting 80 percent of people displaced by climate change . On 9 March, the FAO Regional Office for Africa paid special tribute to African rural and indigenous women and their contribution to climate action and sustainable agrifood systems transformation through an interactive online dialogue with leaders from the African Women’s Collaborative for Healthy Food Systems and ENDA Pronat . The virtual celebration highlighted how rural and indigenous women are actively promoting healthy food systems through agroecology, regenerative approaches, and indigenous foodways. Challenges to women producers in Zambia and Uganda In the Central Province of Zambia, interviews by the African Women’s Collaborative for Healthy Food Systems revealed that many women had no control over the land they use for farming, which belongs to their spouse or relatives. “We have land, but to use it for farming, I have to seek permission from my husband, who decides on the type of crops to grow and how to use the proceeds from our sales,” said Universe Mafuta Mazaba. Restina Mumba, a Petauke-based farmer. She said how hard it has been for her to acquire land from the traditional leaders: “The chiefs should help us not only to access land but also give us certificates for our land, so that our children can also benefit from it. This is the time to advocate for our rights. We want to be independent to grow food that has nutritional value.” In Uganda, female small-scale farmers are facing growing competition for land. Nagitta Rose, a 57-year-old farmer in the Mityana district was once a prominent farmer whose produce was enough to feed the entire community. Unfortunately, her husband was involved in a motorcycle accident, which left him bedridden and unable to protect their land. Since then, their 5-acre farm has been facing different claims of ownership. With no title deed and formal proof of ownership, Nagitta is at a loss to defend the land from encroachers. Limited access to financial resources and credit exacerbates the challenges faced by these women, who are often excluded from land entitlement schemes and may have difficulties understanding lending policies due to reduced access to education. To further complicate their situation, rural and indigenous women are confronted with unreliable seed storage facilities, which represents a threat to food security in the local communities, since much of the food produced comes from their seeds. Resilience through agroecology Notwithstanding the financial, legal, environmental and technical obstacles posed, rural women farmers continue to show admirable tenacity. A key ally in empowering these women to continue working the land is agroecology. Agroecological approaches include diversification of crops, conservation tillage, green manures, organic compost, biological pest control and rainwater harvesting. In Zimbabwe, for example, women have been using traditional knowledge passed down from their ancestors to control pests and diseases without having to depend on chemical pesticides. Nyengeterai Munyani, a vibrant farmer in her 70s, has seven hectares of land on which she grows small grain crops. To preserve her crops and control pests, she makes use of a variety of organic methods: \"I use leaves from paw trees, which I crush while they are fresh and mix with water. I spray my crops with this solution and that deals with the pests and diseases. There are also indigenous trees like mutsviri and mutovhoti whose barks we burn and sprinkle the ashes on our crops.” In the Masvingo province, producer Gogo Mumvuri also practices diversified farming and organic methods of pest and disease control to lessen environmental impact. “When I plant different crops on the same piece of land at the same time, it reduces pests. I also use bark from trees in our area like the mukonde tree, whose ashes get rid of pests,” she said. The adoption of agroecology has also united local communities by providing sharing and learning opportunities for rural women farmers. In the Shashe region of Mashava, Zimbabwe, Vongai Mudzingwa, a 48-year-old seed custodian, explained how agroecology reduced her farming workload, improved her social life, and united her community: \"When planting and harvesting, we call our neighbours and work together as a team. This has fostered unity among us. We are now united because we make use of mushandirapamwe.\" Mushandirapamwe is a Shona word that loosely translates to working together as one, and it is a very common practice among women seed custodians in Shashe. “Thanks to agroecology, we even have free time on our hands. As women seed custodians, we formed a stokvel (club) where we meet every Thursday to share agroecology farming ideas and exchange seeds, as well as other kitchen equipment and groceries we buy with money we get from selling our farm produce,” she added. African rural and indigenous women remain undeterred in their commitment to the practice of agroecology and continue to play crucial roles in maintaining healthy food systems. International Women’s Day reminds us that every day should be dedicated to recongizing and supporting women such as Universe, Restina, Nagitta, Nyengeterai, Gogo and Vongai. It reminds us that we have a critical role to play in tackling discrimination in women’s access to land and natural resources, and addressing gender gaps in rural education, training and finance. Breaking legal and cultural barriers to women’s full engagement in agrifood systems is key to achieving better production, better nutrition, a better environment, and a better life - leaving no one behind.

Despite the key roles that rural women play in food systems, agrobiodiversity conservation, natural resource management, production etc., \" they are particularly affected by the impacts of climate change due to limited access to and control over key resources for adaptation and limited participation in decision-making processes. Similarly, they do not have equal access to the productive resources needed for agricultural livelihoods and are often the last to eat when food is scarce ,\" said Dr Yacine Ndeye N'Dour, Climate Change Expert at the FAO Country Office in Senegal, one of the panelists at the meeting.

      "article_text": "66th Session of the Commission on the Status of Women: Side event by FAO and the African Risk Capacity Group sheds light on the need for gender-sensitive policies and programming... 14 March 2022, Accra – Despite their key role in food systems, rural women lack equal access to productive resources needed for agricultural livelihoods and are often the last to eat when food is scarce - especially when disasters hit. Similarly, their access to climate-adaptation resources and participation in decision-making processes is limited, as leadership in climate action and governance is male-dominated and the decisions are less likely to respond to women’s needs and wants. With this context in focus, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the African Risk Capacity Group (ARC), a specialised agency of the African Union, brought together policy makers and stakeholders for a virtual event this week to promote women’s and girls’ participation and leadership in Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) and financing. The webinar was organized in the context of the 66 th Session of the United Nations (UN) Commission on the Status of Women (CSW66), where Member States, UN entities, and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) from all regions highlighted and discussed this year’s priority theme: “ Achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls in the context of climate change, environmental and disaster risk reduction policies and programmes .” Facilitated by ARC’s Chief Operations Officer, Eva Kavuma, the event emphasised the need for improved policies, gender transformative strategies, and a coordinated effort to progress gender equality towards building true resilience. It also highlighted the urgency to involve women in response programmes in light of the exponential increase, in the past decade, of weather-induced disasters which threaten lives and livelihoods, economic growth and food security. In his opening remarks, Ibrahima Cheikh Diong, UN Assistant Secretary-General and ARC Group Director-General, highlighted that “African policy makers and leaders need to build more resilient and equitable economies by investing in inclusive and gender-responsive climate change and disaster risk reduction programming, plans and policies. These policies need to consider the experience and needs of those who are most affected by the impacts of climate change and disasters, particularly rural women and girls.” Mr Diong was followed by Abebe Haile-Gabriel, FAO Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative for Africa: “We can no longer underestimate the importance of prioritising gender equality in disaster risk reduction and governance in order to ensure transformative change in food systems, humanitarian actions and disaster risk management.” Other participants included Elizabeth Mpofu, Director of the African Women’s Collaborative for Healthy Food Systems, organic farmer and activist; Lillian Matsika Takaendisa, Chief Director of the Gender, Policy Planning and Programme Management of the Ministry of Women Affairs, Community, SMEs Development of Zimbabwe; and Gountiéni D. Lankoandé, Executive Secretary of the Group for Research and Applied Analysis for Development (GRAAD Burkina). Through an interactive panel discussion, speakers painted a picture of the challenges that rural and indigenous girls and women face daily – particularly in relation to land rights and protection. They also touched on policies and best practices which can foster coherence between financing and public investments related to climate change and DRR while promoting gender equality and women’s leadership.

The occasion was celebrated under the theme “Gender Equality Today for a Sustainable Tomorrow,” in Misim Village, Drekikier, East Sepik Province, to recognise the contribution of women and girls, who are leading the charge on climate change adaptation, mitigation, and building a more sustainable future for all. The activities in Misim pulled together close to 1000 farmers, including those from nearby ridges who gathered as early as 7 am to take part and observe. It was like a family occasion for the mothers, girls, and children, all dressed in their proud national colours and joined hands in the various displays and music performed by the youths and also listened to some educational speeches on how to appreciate and value women in their communities. The keynote address delivered by Ms Patu Shang, Programme’s International Gender and Youth Inclusion Specialist, encouraged all men, women and youths to value the critical roles women play in the agri-food value chains, particularly in Cocoa, Vanilla and Fisheries, that are supported under the FAO-led rural agriculture development programme. In attendance was also the Provincial Division of Agriculture and Livestock’s Advisor, Mr Kevin Hawan, who echoed the call for menfolk to not only respect women and girls, but to include them as equal partners in all farming activities as a family. Women farmers from nearby Hambini Village who have been trained on cocoa propagation under the EU-STREIT Programme took the lead to showcase bud grafting skills and techniques to produce Cocoa Pod Borer (CPB)-tolerant seedlings. The women farmers from Misim Village also demonstrated how to properly cure and dry vanilla beans. This occasion was also a learning opportunity for many farmers who attended with their children. Another highlight of the celebration was a Facebook-Live Panel Discussion, during which five female and a male panelists shared their experiences on challenges and way forward on agriculture-related works they initiated in their different villages and with the support of the EU-STREIT PNG Programme. The discussions centred around how women are more vulnerable and prone to experience adverse impacts of climate change, including food and nutrition insecurity, and how women should be given equal and fair rights and space to participate in mitigating the impacts of climate change and its resulting consequential issues such as food insecurity and natural disasters in their communities. The discussions also addressed the negative and unfair cultural constraints women face as community members to take part freely in agricultural development. Learn more"

      "article_text": "Joint FAO/IFAD/WFP News Release on International Women’s Day Portrait of rural women in Burkina Faso. ©Horst Wagner Rome – As climate extremes become more frequent and intense, women and girls - who are at a higher risk than men and boys of experiencing the devastating effects of the climate crisis - including food insecurity, need to be front and centre when planning and implementing climate change adaptation solutions, said three United Nations' food agencies at their joint International Women's Day event today. Organized by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP), the event recognized the contribution of women and girls around the world who play a crucial role in climate change adaptation and mitigation. It also highlighted the need for women’s meaningful participation in decision-making processes related to climate resilience and adaptation. Women and girls’ disproportionate dependence on climate-sensitive work, such as farming, and their limited access to economic and production resources, and services and information increases their susceptibility to the devastating impacts of cyclones, floods and droughts, which in-turn impacts their livelihoods and food security. Globally, 80 percent of the people displaced due to climate-related disasters are women. When homes are destroyed by climatic shocks, such as hurricanes, cyclones and earthquakes, women and girls are forced to flee to displacement camps, where they are often exposed to increased violence. “To have any meaningful and long-lasting impact, women and girls cannot be left out - they must be at the centre of solutions and at the table designing those solutions,” said Maria Helena Semedo, FAO Deputy Director-General and Chair of the FAO Women’s Committee, in closing the event. FAO supports countries to develop gender-responsive climate policies and actions in agriculture, forestry, fisheries and livestock. A specially designed programme aims to strengthen women’s leadership and negotiation skills, so they can become climate change negotiators. FAO also promotes parliamentary actions for targeted gender-budgeting and investments in agri-food systems in the context of climate change and COVID-19 response. It also assists Members to adopt gender-responsive good practices to support climate-smart agriculture and is a leading implementing agency of the Global Environment Facility and the Green Climate Fund . “The 1.7 billion women and girls living in the world’s rural areas are far more likely to be affected by climate shocks and conflicts – by an order of magnitude. Yet they are the ones that disproportionately contribute to the long-term resilience of our communities, nutrition and livelihoods. IFAD is working with rural women to strengthen adaptation to climate change in rural areas and preserve the natural resources on which we all rely,” said Jyotsna Puri, IFAD Associate Vice-President. “With the right type of investments and recognition, they can help build a better future for all of us.” Through its Adaptation for Smallholder Agriculture Programme (ASAP), IFAD prioritises women’s empowerment. It promotes women’s participation in community planning and decision-making on adaptation and ensures women access trainings and equipment such as drip irrigation and solar pumps. In Gambia, for example, through access to suitable water management systems and trainings in soil fertilisation and transplanting, women have diversified and increased food production, earned higher incomes and have strengthened their community’s resilience to climate change. “Vulnerable communities including women and girls on the frontlines of the climate crisis need urgent support to adapt and build resilience, said WFP’s Assistant Executive Director, Valerie Guarnieri. “WFP provides climate solutions that empower women with access to early warning information and forecast-based financing before a disaster strikes and trains women on climate resilient agricultural practices.” In Guatemala, where frequent and intense droughts, as well as excessive rains, severe flooding and landslides have led to chronic food insecurity in recent years, WFP has launched parametric insurance that offers women smallholder farmers and entrepreneurs coverage against droughts and excess rain to protect their livelihoods in the event of a climatic shock. The insurance guarantees pay-outs of up to $300 and ensures that they are able to meet their basic needs even in the face of a disaster. The project targets indigenous women in the community, noting their particular vulnerabilities. Women have been severely underrepresented in important decision-making processes regarding climate change solutions. The lack of fair representation of women in climate change adaptation frameworks results in the creation of solutions that do not accurately respond to the different needs of the diverse groups of people affected by the threats of climate change. Empowering women to ensure their full participation in climate change adaptation decisions and frameworks is crucial for achieving a more sustainable world.

      "article_text": "Changing Climates: Equality today for a sustainable tomorrow HARARE, 8 March 2022 – The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in Zimbabwe today joins the world in commemorating International Women’s Day 2022. Held under the theme #BreakingTheBias, whether deliberate or unconscious, bias especially in the food and agriculture sector makes it difficult for women to progress. Knowing that bias exists isn't enough. Action is needed to level the playing field in this sector. This year’s commemorations are being held when the world is battling with the effects of climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic among other multiple challenges – women and girls have suffered this burden the most. “Climate change affect men and women differently. It is therefore impossible to build resilience in households and communities without addressing systemic gender inequality as gender influences sensitivity to disturbances and, even within the same household, individuals will experience shocks and stresses in different ways,” said Dr. Patrice Talla, FAO Subregional Coordinator for Southern Africa and FAO Representative to Zimbabwe. March 8 is marked around the world as International Women’s Day. For many women in Africa, including those in the agriculture sector, it will be just another day where invisible barriers hold them back from their true potential. FAO believes that inclusivity and fairness are key to achieving sustainable development in agriculture, and that this objective cannot be obtained without accounting for the central role played by women in the sector, including in agriculture markets, trade and value-chain development. In Zimbabwe, FAO has played a big role in recognizing, advocating and celebrating the contribution of women and girls to building sustainable agri-food systems. FAO projects, that have been implemented in the country have immensely contributed to food and nutrition security were implemented anchored around gender equality and women empowerment. Adaptation to climate change entails building households and community capacities to not only survive and recover from current crises, but also strengthen their defences in the face of future threats. Through the Livelihoods and Food Security Programme (LFSP) and cyclone IDAI recovery projects, assets accumulated through small livestock ownership by women helped build resilience to climatic shocks and cushioned households during covid-19. Under social norms, women that own assets are given strong rights to control income and decisions on how to spend the money. Ownership and control of assets by women increases their decision-making power and control of benefits from agriculture. Small livestock ownership by women has been shown to have a direct co-relationship with improved household nutrition and building household resilience to climatic and other shocks. Women are usually the first adopters of climate smart technologies and agro-ecology. With 70% of those receiving extension training on climate change being women, FAO has seen women and girls play a key role in climate change adaptation and mitigation as well as disaster risk reduction in many communities. Female farmers and fisherwomen are using the vital knowledge gained in early warning systems and production techniques, to better adapt to changing climatic conditions. FAO shares a commitment to promoting gender equality and women’s empowerment in agri-food systems through community-based facilitated and pluralistic approaches to extension that respond to wider livelihood options and increased reach for women and girls. Being the most impacted through climate change, and the majority of farm workers, women are a critical part of the solutions in managing natural forest resources and indigenous seed systems especially, neglected and under-utilized seeds. Where projects have empowered women, rural farming households are making joint decisions regarding which crops to grow with females making more decisions on crops compared to their male counterparts. According to FAO Assistant Director General and Regional Representative for Africa Abebe Haile-Gabriel, “Women are crucial to Africa’s agricultural development. They play a crucial role in agriculture in the region. They contribute significantly to food production, processing and marketing, household food security and nutrition, natural resources management and conservation of biodiversity in the face of climate change. In recognition of women’s roles, this year’s International Women’s Day theme focuses on the importance of gender equality for sustainability. On International Women’s Day and every day, FAO champions gender equality and women’s empowerment for a sustainable tomorrow.” Let us all join hands and raise awareness on the gender-differentiated impacts of climate change on agri-food systems, and on the interventions needed to address them, build women and girls’ resilience, and unleash their potential to mitigate climate change and adapt to its impacts.

Achieving gender equality for women means promoting their vital role in science and all of these disciplines. On International Day of Women and Girls in science, let’s meet just four of GFCM’s women leading the way: Elisabetta Betulla Morello has a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in marine biology and works as a fishery resources officer at the GFCM. An Italian and Australian national, she spent nearly two decades as a research scientist at Italy’s National Research Council and Australia’s Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. “I joined the GFCM after 20 years as a research scientist studying fisheries and the impacts of human activities on marine ecosystems,’’ she says. “I have had an incredible time doing research on important themes related to the interaction between humans and the marine environment and how to ensure its sustainability.” Betulla’s advice to young women seeking a career in science is simple. “Read, read, read and be rigorous, meticulous and honest,” she says. “Think before you ask questions and always believe in yourself. Finally, play as hard as you work.” Globally, fewer than 30 percent of the world’s scientific researchers are women. Elisabetta Betulla Morello (Left/Top) and Olfa Ben Abdallah (Right/Bottom) bring their expertise to the GFCM, from analysing marine ecosystems to assessing local fish stocks. © Elisabetta Betulla Morello ©Olfa Ben Abdallah Yoana Georgieva comes from the Bulgarian city of Burgas on the west coast of the Black Sea. She has always had a passion for the water. “My father was a professional diver, and I literally grew up by the sea,” she says. “He used to take my sister and me on expeditions, so the sea is in my veins, and I chose to make it my profession.” Yoana did her PhD on ecosystem modeling and fish stock assessment – the first ever to be completed on the topic in her native language of Bulgarian. She has been a scientist for more than 12 years and is a researcher at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. Yoana also works as a consultant for GFCM’s BlackSea4Fish project , undertaking data collection, processing and analysis of fish stocks. She examines the state of exploited species, including the anchovy, red mullet and turbot, and provides recommendations to support the recovery of the Black Sea ecosystem and the livelihoods of local fishers. “For the past seven years, I have been involved in Black Sea fish stock assessment activities…. I am contributing to efforts for the sustainable management of the Black Sea’s exploited fish stocks. It is not just a profession but also a lifestyle for me. ‘’ Yoana offers, “My advice to the future girls in science is to work hard, be curious and aim higher and higher. And to never give up.” Women need science. Science needs women. Olfa Ben Abdallah was born in eastern Tunisia and has a PhD in Fisheries. Olfa was the first in her family to pursue a career in science and has been working in this field for 15 years. She is a researcher at Tunisia’s National Institute of Marine Sciences and Technologies and participates in the GFCM’s technical groups as a national expert in demersal fish stocks and coastal crustaceans. Her research uses available data to create sustainable models for fish stocks. She says her GFCM involvement enables her to make a greater contribution at an international level. “Fishing is not only an activity between a commercial species and a fisher,” Olfa says. “I am conducting temporal and spatial studies on levels where ecosystem components are affected.” Olfa believes that “female scientists can leverage their skills, gain confidence, reduce the skills gap and expand the pool of talent.” Her message is to “be persistent and innovative because women need science and science needs women”. Achieving gender equality for women means promoting their vital role in science. Marianna GiannoulakI (above) has been working with the GFCM for more than 10 years, contributing to the management and conservation of marine resources. © Marianna GiannoulakI A Greek national, Marianna GiannoulakI has a PhD on population dynamics and habitat modeling of small pelagics. She has been involved in GFCM working groups for more than 10 years. Marianna is a research director at the Hellenic Centre of Marine Research and Institute of Marine Biological Resources and Inland Waters. Working with the GFCM, Marianna enjoys contributing to the management and conservation of marine resources beyond her shores. She says the work has broadened her perspective. “The GFCM provides a unique opportunity to unite the Mediterranean, to bring people together from different cultures and backgrounds towards a common goal: to understand and protect this unique ecosystem,” she says. She has an encouraging message for young women interested in science. “Do not give up, obstacles are there to be overcome. It is only with heart that great achievements are made.” We need gender equality to tap into the full potential of humankind. Let’s start by ensuring that women’s contributions are recognised at all levels and in all areas of society. Learn more"

The project, Promoting Employment and Entrepreneurship Opportunities among Women and Youth in Agriculture and Agribusiness in Eastern Africa , is being implemented in Burundi, Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan and Uganda. It is set to facilitate and ensure enhanced knowledge and application of digital solutions in agri-food systems with a particular focus on women and youth. It is also strengthening human and institutional capacities, while providing agripreneurs with the opportunities to access finance for agri-food systems development. During the virtual launch event, David Phiri, FAO Subregional Coordinator for Eastern Africa and Representative to the AU and United Nations Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA), recalled that the Eastern Africa subregion was home to 50 percent of the highly food insecure population of the whole of Africa and, hence, aiding this subregion meant supporting the whole of Africa. He further noted that the subregion was experiencing stress due to multiple shocks, such as desert locust infestation, climate-induced shocks, conflicts and political instability, and socio-economic strains. The COVID-19 pandemic posed additional risks, which significantly compromised the livelihoods of millions of people, particularly the youth and women. To alleviate this challenge, FAO, in collaboration with development partners, was engaged in several interventions, supporting decent employment, agripreneurship and resilience building for youth and women in the agriculture sector.

      "article_text": "Social norms, defined as the unwritten rules existing within a given group or society, can strongly shape the way people live and behave. They are usually deep-rooted, unconscious and rarely unchallenged. Sometimes they may be too sensitive to discuss, becoming a taboo. When it comes to gender, these norms can affect the interactions and power relations between men and women within households and/or entire communities. They can create and perpetuate inequalities that often curb women’s access to resources and opportunities, thereby undermining their productivity and incomes, which can severely threaten food and nutrition security. Confronting harmful social norms is a complex yet feasible and potentially extremely beneficial endeavor. This is what tells the evidence from the Social Analysis and Action in Food and Nutrition Security (SAA-FNS), a tested methodology developed by CARE International in order to transform gender and social norms through a community-led participatory process. To become familiar with the methodology and discuss its application in their work, about 50 colleagues from the United Nations Rome-based Agencies (RBAs) – FAO , IFAD and WFP – as well as the European Union attended a technical learning workshop on the SAA-FNS. FAO and CARE hosted virtually the workshop on 16 December 2021 in the framework of the Joint Programme on Gender Transformative Approaches for Food Security and Nutrition (JP GTA), implemented by the three RBAs in collaboration with and through the financial support of the European Union . “This successful initiative contributed to promoting staff’s capacity development and expanding the gender transformative agenda across the RBAs’ work, both of which are central to the JP GTA’s mandate,” said Hajnalka Petrics, the JP GTA Global Coordinator. “But this is just part of the beginning of a larger process. By getting familiar with the methodology and discussing possible ways to apply it, colleagues should be better able to refine them and take action aimed for a positive impact on households’ and communities’ food security and nutrition.” Delivered by CARE’s team of experts who have developed the methodology, the workshop presented the key components of the SAA-FNS and promoted an interactive session to assess the audience’s ideas on how to apply the methodology in their working practices. This way, not only the participants were encouraged to think of possible actions but they also had the opportunity to receive customized guidance from CARE’s experts and feedback from their colleagues on their ideas. “The SAA-FNS is an approach that CARE uses to stimulate critical reflection and action on discriminatory social and gender norms,” stressed Abinet Tasew, CARE’s Senior Technical Advisor for Gender and Livelihoods. “It uses participatory tools to achieve the long-term goal of empowering vulnerable communities through the advancement of equitable power dynamics in relation to gender and social norms.” The SAA-FNS process is led by the very communities benefitting from it. Rather than providing top-down directions, the methodology encourages the collective thinking and flows through horizontal communication across community members, breaking the silos and exploring rarely or never discussed topics among them. A mixed or selected group of people sit to discuss common issues, dig into their causes, and come up with possible solutions. The dialogue is assisted by a facilitator, who walks participants through an evolving conversation that improves mutual understanding and allows for collaborative mindset shift. “Unlike a trainer who gives knowledge to his/her students and always has answers, a facilitator values the experiences and knowledge of the participants. A facilitator poses the problems and sets the process in which the participants themselves search for answers and solutions,” highlighted Pranati Mohanraj, CARE’s Senior Technical Advisor. Through a progressive series of discussions, community members accept to engage in a critical self-reflection about their gender norms, seeking to better understand their impacts on food and nutrition security, and to find motivation to change these norms if their impact is negative. The facilitator’s intervention must be subtle yet stimulating, taking careful consideration of the complexity and sensitivities in the local context and following the principle of “do no harm” to the communities. This is why the first step of the methodology is that those who apply and facilitate the process should first critically assess their own thinking about gender equality and gender relations, and consider possible effects on their actions. “Critical thinking must begin with ourselves,” said Ilaria Sisto, FAO’s Gender and Development Officer. “This is part of an innovative learning process that aims to trigger change in the ways we do our work. With this workshop, we hope RBA colleagues and partners will be better able to foster reflection at the household and community levels.” JP GTA website: https://www.fao.org/joint-programme-gender-transformative-approaches/ JP GTA flyer (in English): https://www.fao.org/publications/card/en/c/CB7065EN JP GTA flyer (in Spanish): https://www.fao.org/publications/card/es/c/CB7065ES Social Analysis and Action (SAA): https://www.care.org/our-work/health/strengthening-healthcare/social-analysis-and-action-saa/ Contacts: Hajnalka Petrics, Global Coordinator of the JP GTA: [email protected] JP GTA: [email protected]"

      "article_text": "The use of theatrical debate is part of the JP GTA’s efforts to help the RBAs address discriminatory norms and promote an institutional culture free from negative unconscious gender bias. CC0 Public Domain It may be tenuous, unconscious, even unnoticeable, but it often happens precisely because of these circumstances. The gender-based discrimination can take multiple forms and perpetuate unequal power relations. Reduced to their condition, those who experience gender-based discrimination may not fully realize what is happening to them. This is when observers can step in. When developing his Theatre of the Oppressed methodology in the 1970s, the Brazilian drama theorist Augusto Boal wanted to involve the audience in the problem solving. Among his techniques is the Forum Theatre: by watching the misery and inequity of the oppressed, spectators would raise their voices to identify the wrongdoings and come up with ideas and possible solutions. The play turns into a debate – in other words, the theatre becomes a forum for discussion. Marking the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence Campaign, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) hosted an online learning event on 2 December 2021 adopting the Forum Theatre technique to spotlight common oppressive actions that may eventually lead to gender-based violence (GBV). The session was organized within the framework of the European Union-funded Joint Programme on Gender Transformative Approaches for Food Security and Nutrition (JP GTA), which is being implemented by the three United Nations Rome-based Agencies (RBAs) – the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the World Food Programme (WFP). Unconscious gender bias at the workplace and at home The facilitator Olivier Malcor introduces the session and is followed by his colleague Claudia Signoretti. But every time Claudia attempts to articulate an idea, Olivier will interrupt her to present his own perspective instead. Claudia gets upset and starts faltering. “You are getting emotional,” says Olivier. Intrigued, the audience reacts against him: “Stop interrupting her. Let her talk.” To defend himself, Olivier responds he is just trying to support Claudia’s reasoning. “What if she was a male colleague? Would you have behaved the same way?”, ask a few attendees who see there is a clear gender-based discrimination. What initially appeared to be the formal introduction of a workshop was actually a call for action. Claudia and Olivier were both acting to provoke the audience using the Invisible Theatre technique that is not immediately recognizable. The heated debate in Claudia’s defence demonstrated how common subtle attitudes by men and women may be in fact unconscious gender biases. Following the initial segment of the discussion, the facilitators Claudia and Olivier took on the roles of the characters Anna and Jo’, respectively, this time in a pre-announced theatrical play. Anna is continuously subjugated by Jo’, her husband, on day-to-day affairs, like when she is at the office. “I called you several times! Why didn’t you answer the phone? Who are you with? Turn on your camera and show me who is around there,” says Jo’ in an aggressive tone. “I will pick you up at work. You’d better be down at 6 pm sharp, otherwise I will go up to your office to bring you down.” Jo’s hostile behaviour disturbs Anna, who gets agitated and loses focus. Stop! The stage is now open to the audience. The selected group of 40 attendees is invited to discuss the action, comment about the character they felt was oppressed, struggling or lacking power, and propose alternative solutions by taking part in the performance. Back to theatrical action, a spectator joins the office scene to play the role of Anna’s colleague: “Anna, are you okay? I couldn’t help to notice your discomfort. How are you feeling?” The audience applauded the empathy shown by Anna’s colleague. “She made Anna feel comfortable, without judgments,” commented one spectator. “When asked by the actor playing her colleague about her feelings, Anna realizes that Jo’s behaviour is not normal. The change in the status quo needs to come from Anna,” said another attendee. Anna herself appreciated it: “My colleague helped me become aware of what was happening to me.” A safe and creative way to test solutions This was one of the first attempts to apply the Theatre of the Oppressed in an online session. This IFAD-led JP GTA initiative aimed to raise awareness about unconscious gender bias and its impact in the workplace, field operations and daily life. “In a dynamic and interactive way, the session offered the possibility to recognize power dynamics where GBV could occur or be reinforced,” says Ndaya Beltchika, IFAD’s Lead Technical Specialist for Gender, Targeting and Social Inclusion. “The Theatre-Forum contributes to identifying possible and concrete ways of interventions for GBV prevention, mitigation and response; and helps test out solutions for problematic situations in a safe and creative environment, before acting them out in the daily life.” This innovative drama-debate event was largely appraised by the participants. Augusto Boal’s Theatre of the Oppressed was inspired by the Brazilian educator Paulo Freire’s Pedagogy of the Oppressed , a 1968 book that is considered one of the foundations of critical pedagogy. “It is only when the oppressed find the oppressor out and become involved in the organized struggle for their liberation that they begin to believe in themselves. This discovery cannot be purely intellectual but must involve action; nor can it be limited to mere activism, but must include serious reflection: only then will it be a praxis,” said Paulo Freire in his masterpiece. United to tackle the root causes of GBV The use of theatrical debate is part of the JP GTA’s efforts to help the RBAs address discriminatory norms and promote an institutional culture free from negative unconscious gender bias, thereby fostering gender transformative change both at programming and organizational levels across the RBAs. “Our fight against hunger must encompass a profound transformation in the ways people and societies deal with gender issues, including GBV,” says Hajnalka Petrics, the JP GTA Global Coordinator. “To be able to effectively challenge and change the discriminatory norms and other root causes of gender inequalities, the transformation has to start with ourselves, with the employees of the RBAs and their partners. Through the Joint Programme, the RBAs are working together to systematize and upscale approaches that can help us understand our own gender biases and the most elemental causes of gender inequalities, including those that drive GBV.” ________________________________________ To learn more: • JP GTA website: https://www.fao.org/joint-programme-gender-transformative-approaches/ • JP GTA flyer (in English): https://www.fao.org/publications/card/es/c/CB7065EN • JP GTA flyer (in Spanish): https://www.fao.org/publications/card/es/c/CB7065ES Contacts: • Silvia Sperandini, IFAD Technical Advisory Committee Member, JP GTA: [email protected] • Hajnalka Petrics, Global Coordinator of the JP GTA: [email protected] • JP GTA: [email protected]"

      "article_text": "On International Day of Rural Women, FAO launches new guide 15 October 2021, Accra – The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) Regional Office for Africa has launched a new brief that advocates for seizing the opportunities of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) for the economic empowerment of women in agriculture. The publication is launched today to coincide with the International Day for Rural Women which is celebrated every year on 15 October to honour women and girls living in rural areas. The AfCFTA holds the potential to contribute significantly to eliminating poverty, creating jobs, and improving food security. However, the new publication Seizing the opportunities of the African Continental Free Trade Area for the economic empowerment of women in agriculture warns that the AfCFTA could exacerbate existing gender disparities and discrimination and worsen the condition of women engaged in trade and agriculture if women’s inclusion is not prioritized. The AfCFTA will change existing trading practices and formalize markets which could preclude women’s access and further relegate them to informal and less lucrative value chains. “Women must not be left behind,” said FAO Senior Gender Officer Clara Park. “It is of pivotal importance that we create ecosystems of support that enable women to access opportunities created through the AfCFTA and reinvigorate our efforts to address existing gender inequalities in access to and control over land, services, technology, markets and knowledge. We need to bring women and their organizations to the decision making table,” she said. Women’s key role in Africa’s food production and trade Around 85 percent of economic activity in Africa is conducted in the informal sector where women account for nearly 90 percent of the informal labour force. Many rural women also sell goods and agricultural produce through informal trade channels and cross-border trade. The African Continental Free Trade Area agreement establishes the largest free-trade area in the world. The single market aims to enhance intra-African trade, facilitate investment, improve continental economic integration, and boost African countries’ competitiveness in the global market. Some of the many benefits women can reap by trading under the AfCFTA include moving up the value chain, leveraging networks of women’s associations, upgrading their businesses, and tapping into new markets. Ensuring women’s inclusion The publication makes recommendations relevant to stakeholders across the trade sector, including: strategic partnerships to develop innovative solutions and policy recommendations to ensure that the implementation of the AfCFTA agreement will provide opportunities that benefit women; build the capacity of women and women’s organizations so that they are involved in Africa’s trade environment and understand what the AfCFTA agreement entails, including its opportunities and challenges; and engage the private sector to connect with women’s groups involved in agricultural value chains. FAO recognizes that women play a critical role in food production in Africa. FAO is working with partners to unlock the potential of trade and seize the opportunities of the AfCFTA for rural women.

This year's IDRW comes as the world continues to face the challenge of the COVID-19 pandemic which has exacerbated existing gender inequalities faced by rural women. These include challenges in accessing resources, opportunities and services, as a result of entrenched social norms and patriarchal systems. The Joint Programme Accelerating Progress Towards the Economic Empowerment of Rural Women (JP RWEE) is implemented in Ethiopia, Guatemala, Kyrgyzstan, Liberia, Nepal, Niger and Rwanda by four UN agencies: the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), UN Women, and the World Food Programme (WFP). It adopts a holistic approach to women's economic empowerment, encompassing social and political domains of empowerment. In Nepal, the programme is being implemented in the southern Rautahat and Sarlahi districts, where discriminatory social norms are deeply entrenched and women face multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination, including confinement to the home, which severely limit their participation in rural life and decision making. To address these complex challenges, the JP RWEE in Nepal implemented the Gender Action Learning System (GALS), a community-led empowerment methodology used to achieve more equitable gender relations. This involves actively engaging men and boys in household and community discussions which gives rise to the inclusion of the voices of women and girls in daily life and decision making. During the COVID-19 pandemic, these gatherings and discussions were severely impacted by strict lockdowns and prohibition of meetings to combat the spread of the virus. Learn more"

      "article_text": "FAO-IFAD webinar showcases gender transformative approaches and tools for women’s financial inclusion, drawing audience of over 200. An event co-hosted by FAO and IFAD in the framework of the Joint Programme on Gender Transformative Approaches for Food Security and Nutrition (JP GTA) brought together experts in financial inclusion and women’s empowerment to share examples of transformative approaches that can improve access to financial products and services for rural women. Over 200 participants tuned in for the discussion that was moderated by Azeta Cungu, Rural Finance Officer at FAO. The JP GTA is implemented by the three United Nations Rome-based Agencies – FAO, IFAD and WFP – with financial support from the European Union. Women’s financial inclusion is a key theme for the JP GTA and constitutes the focus of its field level activities in Malawi. Delivering opening remarks, Willem Olthof, Deputy Head of Unit for Sustainable Agri-Food Systems and Fisheries at the European Commission’s Directorate-General for International Partnerships, underscored the EU’s strong support for the Joint Programme as part of its commitment to promoting gender equality and women’s empowerment in international cooperation. He added that the EU’s new Gender Action Plan III for 2021-2025 aims at tackling the structural causes of gender inequality by taking a transformative and rights-based approach, and therefore has gender transformative approaches as one of its three core principles. Setting the scene Susan Kaaria, Senior Gender Officer at FAO, noted that approximately 1.1 billion women around the world lack access to basic formal financial services, with the global gender gap in bank account ownership of women compared to men remaining unchanged at around 7% since 2011. She highlighted that recognizing and addressing discriminatory social norms is key to ensuring women’s financial inclusion and achieving gender equality and women’s empowerment. “For example, because of socio-cultural norms, women may be less mobile than men,” she explained. “What this leads to is that they may be limited in their ability to travel long distances to reach financial institutions, so they are not able to open bank accounts, take loans or deposit savings. In other instances, rural women may not be viewed as legitimate clients for financial institutions, despite being actively engaged in agriculture activities, because they are seen as primarily associated with the domestic sphere.” The value of applying gender transformative approaches that take into account structural, practical and normative barriers – as opposed to gender sensitive programs that focus mainly on equal distribution of resources – was outlined by Dr. Saskia Vossenberg, Lead Gender, Migration and Remittances at the United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) . She emphasized that in order to see lasting results for women’s financial inclusion, deeply rooted systemic inequalities need to be addressed at various levels. “There are multiple constraints that exist both on the demand and supply side,” she said. “Many of them originate outside the financial sector, and they are interlinked. So what happens in the market or when we seek financial services is very much related to what happens at home, behind our front door or also in the policy system.” Gender transformative approaches for financial inclusion that work Highlighting the role of social norms and the constraints they create for women, Nisha Singh, Gender Transformative Solutions Lead at FinEquity , shared a methodology developed by CGAP to better understand the drivers of women’s behaviour. A social norms diagnostics study conducted in Turkey identified the priority norms – ranging from ‘women should not have financial privacy from their husbands’ to ‘women should not have assets in their own name’ – that were influencing women’s behaviour. Based on the information collected, CGAP was able to identify potential entry points for designing financial products, services, policies and interventions to meet women’s needs. The provision of improved financial services was combined with addressing normative barriers to create greater acceptance among household and community members of the woman’s role as not only as a caregiver but also as an economic agent. This methodology is currently being tested in five countries as part of a collaborative learning program called the Social Norms Diagnostic Co-Lab , run by CGAP and FinEquity, with results due to be published later this year. The JP GTA has joined as a partner of the Co-Lab and is running the diagnostic in Malawi, one of its focus countries. Grace Majara, Financial Inclusion Senior Technical Advisor at CARE USA, presented CARE’s Village Savings and Loans Associations (VSLAs) approach that brings together around 15-30 women from a community to pool their savings and lend money among themselves. VSLAs have proven immensely successful not only in driving women’s economic empowerment but also in improving food security, addressing gender-based violence and promoting women’s leadership. For a project in Uganda , CARE’s VSLA approach was coupled with a digital financial product, the so-called Digital Sub-Wallet for Women Financial Empowerment, tailored to women’s habits and goals, as well as household dialogues to address intra-household inequality and engage with power holders. Aimed at strengthening women’s voice, financial autonomy and equal participation in managing household finances, the project saw powerful results. Many women who confessed to having previously hidden cash in a secret place at home decided to open bank accounts, and the overwhelming majority saw a significant improvement in spousal behaviour, mutual trust and joint decision-making. Women’s financial inclusion key to ending hunger To create systemic opportunities for women's financial inclusion, it is critical to develop a deep understanding of local markets, examine how norms shape all actors in the system and change the incentives that drive their behaviour. This message was echoed in the closing remarks delivered by Steven Jonckheere, Senior Technical Specialist for Gender and Social Inclusion at IFAD. Steven stressed that without taking into account and acting on discriminatory social norms, there will be no progress either on the financial inclusion of rural women or – given the important role that women play in food systems – more broadly on ending hunger. To address the social constraints that women face, IFAD applies the Financial Action Learning System (FALS), a participatory methodology that has shown positive results and created a “win-win partnership” between financial service providers and their clients. “If we want to effectively address the gender gap in financial inclusion and achieve zero hunger, we need to bring these experiences to scale collectively and learn from each other; each one of us building on our respective expertise and comparative advantage, be it as researchers, policy makers, development partners, civil society or financial service providers,” he concluded.

      "article_text": "As producers, processors, retailers, distributors and exporters, women play many important roles in Guyana’s fruit and vegetable agri-food value chain. ©FAO/Shara Seelall Whether it is in Anna Regina, Georgetown or Corriverton, Guyana’s markets are traditionally dominated by female vendors. Be it fresh fruits and vegetables or agro-processed products, their stalls display abundance and variety. The vendors’ melodious chants soar above the usual market hustle and bustle: A “What are you getting today, love?” floats through the air at each turn. Beyond the surface of this vibrant yet complex market and deeper into the country’s agri-food chain, women play many roles. According to a report by the Central Bank of Guyana, fruits and vegetables contributed USD 3.3 million in exports to the country’s economy from January to June in 2020. These numbers have women’s work behind them. Aside from growing many of these crops, women are also generally behind the processing of these foods, producing items such as pepper sauces, jams, jellies, seasonings and dried fruits, and retailing them for export. As 2021 is the International Year of Fruits and Vegetables , a year designated to raise awareness on the importance of these foods in nutrition, food security and health, it is an opportune time to zero-in on the contribution of women to the value chain behind fruits and vegetables. FAO in Guyana has been working with farmers to reduce post-harvest losses as well as to develop markets for traditional crops like cassava. Left/Top: ©Brent Stirton/Getty Images for FAO; Right/Bottom: ©FAO/Miguel Schincariol Across many farming communities of Guyana, women are well-known for producing cash crops and growing vegetables like bora, pumpkin, pak choy, tomatoes and peppers, as well as fruits such as watermelons and passion fruit among others. While some women carry out these activities as ‘kitchen gardens’ to maintain self-sufficiency and support the needs of their households, other women like Malika Deokarran produce food on a larger scale to supply traders and markets. Malika is also the leader of a 75-member farming group in her community in Belle West in the northern part of the country. Despite the group being majority male, Malika discloses that everyone depends on her guidance to package and price their produce and advocate for farmers’ assistance. Malika describes, “My input to the group and their family farms is critical: it takes patience to set the seeds, harvest, package and price the produce daily.” FAO came to Malika’s community to speak with farmers about developing markets for traditional crops like cassava and implementing disaster risk reduction strategies to mitigate the impact of the extreme weather and flooding common to this country. Malika commented that FAO’s support and recognition of the important role that she and other women play in producing fresh fruits and vegetables was a motivation for her: “I am grateful for this visit to our community and supporting us women. We needed this to build our confidence to take on bigger challenges.” Food loss Highly perishable, fruits and vegetables need special attention to maintain quality and safety. Appropriate treatment and handling across the supply chain, from production to consumption, are important to ensure that waste is minimized. Unfortunately, a significant amount continues to be lost. In 2021, Guyana’s Ministry of Agriculture estimated that almost 30 percent of all fruits and vegetables are lost or wasted. Worldwide, the estimate is higher, with up to 50 percent of fruits and vegetables lost in developing countries’ supply chains. This loss and waste represent not only one of food but of natural resources and investments made by the farmers and the country. Jasmin Ramsammy, a vendor at the Skeldon market, located in the eastern county of Berbice, describes, “You have to know when to buy, what to buy and the amount to buy for resale. For instance, around the Diwali and Phagwah festivals, vegetables such as calaloo (pak choy), pumpkin and boulanger (eggplant) are high in demand, so we buy plenty and it sells out.” So, what happens when the perishables are left on hand? According to Nina Sarju, a vendor of Berbice’s Port Mourant market, “If the fruits and vegetables can keep, we sell them the next day. If not, we cook them or share with neighbors and regular customers.” Highlighting best practices in the value chain to avoid food loss is part of FAO’s work with farmers across the country. As guardians of much of Guyana´s food culture, women create livelihood opportunities and improve the food security and nutrition of their families and communities. ©FAO The dedication of women to the fruit and vegetable supply chain is indispensable. Guardians of much of Guyana´s food culture and organizers of the fresh produce market, these women generate income, support empowerment, create livelihood opportunities and improve food security and nutrition. Not to mention that at the end of a normal workday, many women are still traditionally responsible for preparing nutritious foods for their families. FAO supports women food producers, and all smallholder producers, to be more efficient and productive, through trainings on reducing harvest and post-harvest losses and adopting climate smart practices. FAO also supports female farmers by increasing awareness on opportunities to access finance and other farm inputs. Underpinned by the commitment to gender equality, FAO emphasizes the role women play in both the agricultural supply chain and in promoting nutrition, with fruits and vegetables a central part of that.

      "article_text": "13 July 2021 For the first time, FAO assessed Ukraine’s agriculture and rural development sector from a gender perspective As elsewhere in the world, women in Ukraine represent a large proportion of the agricultural labour force and the majority of food producers, and thus play key roles in managing natural resources and promoting the well-being of their families. To explore and analyse gender issues in agriculture and food security, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has developed the first Country Gender Assessment for Ukraine ,. The report – part of FAO’s Country Gender Assessment series , and whose full title is ‘ National Gender Profile of Agriculture and Rural Livelihoods (Ukraine )’ – aims to serve policymakers and practitioners engaged in the formulation and implementation of agriculture policies and programmes, researchers and analysts, civil society actors, and other partners. The report acknowledges women’s role in food systems and rural development, yet it also points out their unequal access to land and other assets and resources, which limits their economic opportunities and puts them at risk of being left behind. Based on these findings, the report provides recommendations on how to address gender inequalities for increased agricultural productivity and food security, and sustainable rural development. Greater agricultural productivity, food security and rural livelihoods, says the report, cannot be achieved without recognising the distinct and complementary roles of women and men, and ensuring social and economic equality for both groups. “The report contributes to the existing knowledge base about gender equality in the country, by bringing together gender statistics and experts’ opinions, but also serving as an advocacy tool to provide greater visibility to rural women’s contribution to agricultural productivity and food security,” said Mara Lopes, FAO Ukraine Head of Office. “Women and girls are critical agents in the fight against rural poverty and food insecurity. Supporting them in reaching their full potential will enable agricultural and rural development processes to be more effective.” “The FAO report on Gender, Agriculture and Rural Development is an in-depth and comprehensive document covering gender issues in the context of different areas of women's and men's lives, including participation in decision-making, freedom from violence, the impact of climate change, access to resources such as land, water energy, education, health and more,” added Kateryna Levchenko, Government Commissioner for Gender Equality Policy. “This makes it a relevant source of information for all a wide range of users”. However, the report finds that rural women in Ukraine are limited in their capacity to contribute to agricultural production and take advantage of new opportunities, being concentrated in informal jobs and overloaded by multiple responsibilities. These include unpaid informal work on family farms, daily housework, and caring for children and other family members. Despite the heavy workload, their effort is often invisible and receives little recognition or economic or social reward. “Since the outbreak of COVID-19, many women across the region find themselves in an even more disadvantaged situation, as evidence points to increased rates of domestic violence and longer hours of care work due to the widespread closure of schools,” said Dono Abdurazakova, FAO Senior Gender and Social Protection Advisor. “Rural women with disabilities, women from ethnic minority groups such as Roma women, women who have been internally displaced, and many more, suffer from multiple vulnerabilities.” One in every six people employed in Ukraine works in agriculture, forestry and fisheries. The report reveals that specific job types within that sector tend to fall into either “female” or “male” occupation categories. Men represent 71 percent of all formal employees in agriculture, forestry and fisheries, whereas women in the same sector tend to work informally. Women make up 56 percent of migrant labour in Ukraine as a whole, and 58 percent of migrant labour in rural areas. Men are more likely to migrate abroad, while women tend to migrate internally. Unsurprisingly, only 20 percent of farming enterprises in Ukraine are headed by women. What is perhaps more surprising is that women generally undertake manual labour, such as cultivation, planting, weeding, and harvesting perishable vegetables, berries and herbs. Men, meanwhile, tend to undertake mechanised work such as tilling, ploughing and planting fodder crops, harvesting grain and corn (with combine harvesters), and transporting products to markets. Men are more likely to engage in large-scale crop production (wheat, corn, sunflowers), while women typically focus on horticulture and herbs. The tendency towards distinct tasks is repeated within the livestock sector, with women active in dairy production and work associated with milking and care of cows, and men usually responsible for transportation and mechanised labour. The report also goes into some detail on food, health and nutrition, broken down by the female and male experience in Ukraine. In terms of life expectancy, Ukrainian women live on average 10 years longer than men, and that gap is even more pronounced in rural communities (76.2 years compared with 65.6 years for men in 2019). This is a pattern reflected across all post-Soviet countries. In Western Europe, by comparison, female life expectancy exceeds that of their male counterparts by just five years.

These expectations inform us about ‘masculinity’ and ‘femininity’, according to the society we live in,” noted Baton. Changing social norms to advance gender equality and women’s empowerment By focusing on participants’ lived experiences, the training was designed to trigger a learning process through reflection on, and questioning of, accepted beliefs and practices that have shaped individuals’ daily lives and continue to guide their behaviours. Despite the personal nature of experiences, discussions highlighted the crosscutting nature of certain gender norms beyond the family, religious, cultural, national or socio-economic context. “Harmful gender norms and prescriptive roles for men and women influence societies by fostering discrimination, creating barriers for women – and often for men as well – and determining who has access to resources, services and benefits. Analysing this context is important to understand the challenges and opportunities, and to decide which discriminatory gender norms and behaviours must be addressed to achieve change that is sustainable in the longer term,” said Silvia Sperandini, Gender and Social Inclusion Programme Support at IFAD. The workshop also offered the possibility to discuss the impact of gendered social norms on development interventions. Ilaria Sisto, FAO Gender and Development Officer, presented the four objectives of FAO’s Policy on Gender Equality for 2020-2030 and invited participants to think about the gender norms that might influence or hinder the achievement of some of these objectives. Discussion groups then explored ways and potential development interventions implemented at different scales – policy, institutional, household/community level – that could help transform these norms and unequal power dynamics to ensure equal opportunities and benefits for all. Strengthening collaboration between the Rome-based Agencies WFP has been implementing training on social norms for its staff for several years. This pilot initiative that saw WFP extend the workshop to staff from FAO and IFAD for the first time forms part of the JP GTA’s broader efforts to enhance collaboration and synergies among the UN Rome-based Agencies. The JP GTA is aimed at contributing to the achievement of SDG2 by supporting the RBAs to embed gender transformative approaches in their policy dialogues, programmes and projects, working modalities and institutional culture. One of its components focuses on strengthening the competency of RBA staff to understand the root causes of inequalities for gender transformative programming. Hajnalka Petrics, Global Coordinator of the JP GTA, explained: “Examining and questioning gendered social norms forms the basis of gender transformative approaches that have the potential to change established gender roles for men and women. The sessions and feedback overwhelmingly confirmed participants’ interest in conducting this type of deep-dive into a topic that is crucial for the work of all three Rome-based Agencies’ to advance gender equality, women’s empowerment and food security.” At the end of the two days, participants emphasized the relevance of the social norms training for their work and recommended rolling it out more widely.

      "article_text": "The discussion session begins with a few words from the dialogue curator, Ms. Eve Crowley, who summarizes the purposes of the proposed discussion and present a global vision on the relevance of the gender approach in food systems. The transformation of food systems is a political, economic and environmental issue, but above all, it is a question of gender equality. The stark inequalities experienced by women and girls are both a cause and a result of unsustainable food systems, unfair access to food, consumption and production. Addressing gender injustice and truly empowering women is not only a fundamental prerequisite for transforming food systems, but also a goal in itself. Shaping food systems so that they are conducive to gender equality requires a combination of improved knowledge, sound policies, regulations and investments throughout the production and consumption process. We need to reframe how we view women and food systems from mainly focusing on the role of women as producers and consumers to thinking about how food and agricultural systems contribute or can contribute to the process of empowering women and how these systems can create an environment conducive to the equal exercise of women's rights.

This year’s International Women’s Day on the 8th March 2021 highlights the role of women in leadership and the key roles they fulfill at various levels (“as health care workers, caregivers, innovators, community organizers and as some of the most exemplary national leaders” UN Women, 2021) in tackling the global COVID-19 crisis. In a similar vein, women are important stakeholders and crucial innovators in the fight against land degradation processes in dryland regions, both before and during the pandemic. The International Women’s Day thus represents the perfect opportunity to reflect on the important and manifold contributions women make in managing and protecting natural resources in arid regions. To this end, FAO’s Dryland Forestry Team evaluated some of the challenges and successes experienced by women within the GEF-7 Sustainable Forest Management Drylands Sustainable Landscape Impact Programs (SFM-DSL IP) . An initiative like Making every voice count for adaptive management highlights the importance of participation at all levels, in all contexts – locally, nationally and internationally. In this initiative, we see women’s involvement at all stages that ensure change is brought and impact is made. Across the drylands, “women are key players in land, livestock, and pasture management” says Tselmeg Chaluunbaatar, FAO Communication Coordinator in Mongolia. Women’s roles are highly varied, endowing them with extensive knowledge. As part of the participatory video initiative Making every voice count for adaptive management , for instance, footage from Ntechu in central Malawi shows Edah Mabalani presenting her conservation agriculture practice of zero tillage for improved soil health. Similarly, vetiver farmer Zaina Anodi explains some of the benefits of hedgerow planting, for instance, to reduce soil erosion. Learn more"

      "article_text": "©FAO/2021: Souad Obeid, The Head of the Water Resources Information Centre in Damascus. Throughout history, the central role of women in society has ensured the stability, progress and long-term development of nations. Today, women in leadership positions are doing extraordinary work and have proven to be successful leaders on many levels, particularly in responding to the COVID-19 global pandemic. In Syria, the war placed a heavy burden on women, where hundreds of thousands have suddenly found themselves refugees, internally-displaced and in many cases have become the head of their households without any stable form of income. Due to Covid-19, new barriers have emerged across the world; women continue to face domestic violence, the burden of unpaid care duties, unemployment and poverty. However, there are bright examples of women inspiring other women to change for balance. The Head of the Water Resources Information Centre in Damascus, Souad Obeid, 50 years old, takes us through her long years of career experience and the challenges she faced during the past 25 years of work. Souad, who began working after completing her studies, was the only female worker amongst her colleagues at the Ministry of Water Resources; within a short period, and with an archive full of researches and academic papers, Souad became an active member and a decision maker in her workplace. “We live in a society where women are supposed to act differently to men, and so when we do prove ourselves, mainly in the workforce, it becomes remarkable,” expressed Souad. From 2002 onwards, Souad has been leading her team of engineers to establish the Water Resources Information Center in the Ministry. The centre created geographical information systems for the Barada Awaj Basin around Damascus and the coastal basins, including data on groundwater, surface water and water quality assessments. When the crisis broke out in 2011, the water and irrigation sector was significantly affected; water networks and irrigation stations across the country were targeted and damaged during armed conflicts. “Ten years of crisis in Syria was the biggest challenge we could ever face. However; giving up was never a choice for me, this gave me the strength to pursue what we all started, myself and the team had to double the efforts to fill the gap and meet the needs, despite facing a huge lack of expertise,” said Souad. In 2015, Souad was assigned as the Head of the Water Resources Information Center in Damascus. The water resources management in Syria continues to face numerous challenges, Souad who received a number of technical training sessions provided by FAO on water resources management, is now involved with FAO in sharing her knowledge with other young technicians, selecting the participants and encouraging female staff to take part in the training to reinforce the concept of gender equality . “I believe women can play a vital role in changing and improving their communities, women can only thrive through obtaining full and equal rights. Society, economy, politics, and all sectors can’t flourish without both gender’s participation,” she stated. “Besides my role as a mother of three children, I am also a leader at my work place, which is no easy task, I did work hard to reach this level and I still believe gender equality is the key to ensure a prosperous future,” added Souad. FAO is committed towards achieving and promoting gender equality in all its areas of work, this is aligned with SDG 5 on “Gender Equality” and women’s empowerment, which is central to FAO's mandate to achieving food security for all, improving agricultural productivity and ensuring the full participation of rural people in decision-making processes. In 2020, FAO designed special training events for women, focusing on entrepreneurship and small-scale business management. The aim is to ensure women’s involvement and full participation in the development of the agricultural sector. According to studies conducted by FAO, statistics shows that when women have equal access to services and resources they contribute significantly to the rural development and the elimination of hunger and poverty. Therefore, FAO joined efforts with its relevant partners to enroll women within its activities and programmes and to achieve equality between women and men in sustainable agricultural production. -Ends- #IWD2021"

This is rolling back the progress that has been made towards gender equality and economic security for women. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, the essential role of women in the fisheries and aquaculture sectors has been downplayed. However, women have been findings ways to uplift each other for years. For example, Morocco has established structured landing sites (called “points de débarquement aménagés” or “PDAs”) in order to improve both the working and social conditions of small-scale fishers. These PDAs provide a space for fishers, where they can store fishing equipment, conduct meetings, sell fish products and use the space for their personal needs. Learn more"

      "article_text": "To bridge the gender gap, FAO and UNDP work with countries to empower women and achieve gender equality in the agriculture sector for a more sustainable future that will benefit all. Women are key to food production. In developing countries, women comprise 45 percent of the agricultural labour force, with that figure rising to 60 percent in parts of Africa and Asia. They therefore play a fundamental role in achieving Sustainable Development Goal 2 on Zero Hunger. However, female farmers have limited access to land, markets and education compared to men, and are not equally involved in decision-making. Studies show that if women had the same access to resources as men, food production would rise by almost 30 percent, potentially resulting in 150 million fewer hungry people in the world. Women bear the brunt of climate change impacts Considering the differences in roles and access to resources between men and women, climate change impacts on agriculture affect them in different ways. In Viet Nam, for example, the majority of agricultural workers are women, as many men migrate to cities to find alternative jobs with more profitable incomes. It is thus mainly the women who experience the direct impacts of climate change in their daily lives. For instance, when sea level rise causes salt water to intrude and destroy whole fields of rice; food security and livelihoods are put at risk. Desperation grows and as described by a Vietnamese farmer in a similar situation : all she can do is pray. This is just one example of how climate change directly affects smallholder farmers, and much has been done to improve the situation. Viet Nam is in fact one of 11 countries where FAO and UNDP worked in close collaboration with the government and other relevant stakeholders to tackle climate change, concentrating on issues related to gender, through the Integrating Agriculture in National Adaptation Plans (NAP-Ag) programme , funded by the German Ministry of Environment, Nature Conservation and Nuclear Safety (BMU) through its International Climate Initiative (IKI) . New knowledge improves gender mainstreaming For the past six years (2015-2020), the NAP-Ag programme supported countries to address challenges and priorities of both women and men in adaptation planning in agriculture, with a major part of its activities focused on monitoring sex disaggregated data and gender mainstreaming. This was done by conducting climate risk and vulnerability assessments and developing multi-criteria approaches to screen adaptation options focused on gender and vulnerable populations. The programme was not only able to promote women’s participation in activities related to agriculture and climate change planning, but also to integrate gender-sensitive adaptation options in countries’ climate change strategies and plans.

      "article_text": "As the country responds to and recovers from the devastating effects of the pandemic, we are offered a valuable opportunity to bring about gender equality, especially for women’s leadership. ©FAO/K.Purevraqchaa Women stand at the frontlines of the COVID-19 crisis in Mongolia. Women are healthcare workers, caregivers and teachers, food producers, social workers and civil servants. In Mongolia, women make up 82 per cent of all healthcare workers, and every day, they risk their own health to care for those affected by the virus. This is why for International Women’s Day 2021, the UN aims to recognize the significant efforts made by women and girls during the pandemic with the theme “Women in Leadership: Achieving an Equal Future in a COVID-19 World”. Yet, as we pay tribute to their tremendous efforts in COVID-19 response and recovery, we must acknowledge that women and girls continue to bear the brunt of the negative impacts of the pandemic. COVID-19 and the measures put in place to control its spread have worsened the already deep inequalities that women and girls face, undoing years of progress made toward gender equality. Women are more likely to work in sectors facing the most difficulties during the pandemic. Micro, small and medium enterprises, which are largely dominated by women, are struggling the most to survive unparalleled disruptions. Unemployment rate is higher among women than men mainly due to the unpaid care work that has increased exponentially due to extended school closures and lockdowns. This added responsibility interferes with their work, their education, and their self-care and personal development during the already challenging past year. Women are the backbone of agriculture, guardians of household food security and are responsible for much of the food production. In Mongolia, herder women also have a vital role in managing the herding businesses and keeping the traditional livestock practices. Yet women, especially in rural areas face greater constraints than men in accessing productive resources, services, technologies, and financial assets, which makes them more vulnerable to the socio-economic effects of COVID-19. Lockdowns and quarantines have made access to social and medical services far more challenging, especially for pregnant women and women with disabilities. Maternal mortality increased by 28 per cent during this period, with at least 5 cases directly linked to pandemic-related risks and concerns. Learn more"

      "article_text": "The event, co-organised by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the World Food Programme (WFP), will focus global attention on the vital role that empowered female farmers, entrepreneurs and leaders need to play so that women can contribute on equal terms to the recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, and in creating an environment to eliminate poverty, enhance productivity, and improve food security and nutrition. “The world is home to more than 1.1 billion girls under the age of 18, who have the potential of becoming the largest generation of female leaders, entrepreneurs and change-makers ever seen for the better future. Yet, women and girls continue to face persistent structural constraints that prevent them from fully developing their potential and hinder their efforts of improving their lives as well as their households and communities,” said FAO Director-General QU Dongyu. “Women and girls can play a crucial role in the response to the COVID-19 pandemic and in particular in transforming our agri-food systems. We all need to work together to spark the necessary changes to empower women and girls, particularly those in rural areas,” he added. “It is essential that women are not only in more leadership positions, but that they are consulted and listened to, and integrated in all spheres and stages of pandemic response and recovery,” said Gilbert F. Houngbo, President of IFAD. “Investing in rural women’s leadership and involving them more in creating our post-COVID future is critical to ensure their perspectives and needs are adequately considered, so that we can build back better food systems where there is equal access to nutritious food and decent livelihoods.” “Women and girls make up half of our global community and it’s time this was reflected in leadership positions at every level,” said David Beasley, Executive Director of WFP. “We know from our work around the world that when women and girls have better access to information, resources and economic opportunities, and are free to make their own decisions, hunger rates fall and nutrition improves not only for themselves but also their families, communities and countries.” Women’s leadership is particularly important in rural areas of developing countries, where the voices of the 1.7 billion women and girls who live there are often overlooked. Sixty percent of women in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa work in agriculture – yet they have less access to resources and services than men, including land, finance, training, inputs and equipment. In addition to their agricultural work, women are overburdened with domestic chores and caring for their families – roles that have increased during the COVID-19 pandemic. At the same time, women are more negatively affected by the social and economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, including losing livelihoods and experiencing decreases in their personal incomes. Ensuring that women have a greater voice is not only a matter of gender equality. Women leaders can advocate for women to have better access to and control over assets and productive inputs, thus boosting their productivity and incomes, leading to food security and increasing their employment opportunities and real wages. Research shows that if women farmers had the same access to productive resources as men, they could increase yields by 20 to 30 percent and total agricultural output by 2.5 to 4 percent, lifting 100 to 150 million people out of hunger. FAO works to strengthen rural women’s engagement and leadership in agri-food systems. FAO also engages with farmers’ organizations to ensure that rural women’s voices are heard and promotes gender-transformative approaches to challenge unfair socio-cultural norms in rural communities. Moreover, FAO supports governments to adopt policies and strategies addressing the needs and aspirations of rural women and girls, enabling them to participate in decision-making and assume leadership positions. This also implies enhancing women’s leadership skills and self-confidence and raising gender awareness within national and local institutions. Within the Organization, FAO has established a Women’s Committee providing an inclusive, safe space that reflects the diverse and energetic nature of FAO’s female workforce. The Organization also created incentives for career prospects for female staff and for achieving gender parity at all levels and across all job categories. Since 2009, IFAD has implemented a ‘household methodologies’ approach to reinforce the equal role and decision-making capacity of women within households, groups and communities. Evidence from Uganda, Rwanda, Kyrgyzstan and other countries has shown that women who take part in the programme take up leadership roles in their organizations and communities, and have a greater voice in decision-making in their households. This has led to greater agricultural productivity. Food security and gender inequality are closely linked with disadvantages beginning at a young age. In many countries boys and girls have very different childhoods. Boys eat first, are given more food than their sisters, do less housework and marry later. For girls, marriage and not school work can dominate their childhoods. WFP’s work in achieving gender equality begins at school where support or implementation of School Feeding programmes in more than 70 countries contributes to increased school attendance of girls. This provides them greater access to education, reduces the risk of child marriage and other forms of gender-based violence, and increases future livelihood and leadership opportunities for girls. # # # The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) is a specialized agency of the United Nations that leads international efforts to defeat hunger. Our goal is to achieve food security for all and make sure that people have regular access to enough high-quality food to lead active, healthy lives. With over 194 member states, FAO works in over 130 countries worldwide. We believe that everyone can play a part in ending hunger. IFAD invests in rural people, empowering them to reduce poverty, increase food security, improve nutrition and strengthen resilience. Since 1978, we have provided US$23.2 billion in grants and low-interest loans to projects that have reached an estimated 518 million people. IFAD is an international financial institution and a United Nations specialized agency based in Rome – the United Nations food and agriculture hub. The United Nations World Food Programme is the 2020 Nobel Peace Prize Laureate. We are the world’s largest humanitarian organization, saving lives in emergencies and using food assistance to build a pathway to peace, stability and prosperity for people recovering from conflict, disasters and the impact of climate change.

Women in rural areas in Europe and Central Asia are still not equally represented in rural institutions and manage only 6.5 percent to 31 percent of agricultural holdings. They are not paid equally, and they remain without equal access to decent jobs, markets and infrastructure. It is estimated that between 60 percent and 87 percent of women working in agriculture are informal or family workers. Health and education are not always adequately provided, and information gaps limit progress towards positive change. Furthermore, the COVID-19 crisis has not only increased women’s work burden but also has posed new challenges in such areas as food security, nutrition, time poverty, access to services, economic opportunities and gender-based violence. However, despite the many challenges women face, they continue to inspire through their leadership, persistence and solidarity. Consider these four stories from women in Europe and Central Asia.

      "article_text": "On Thursday, 18 February 2021 the first of a series of five webinars called “ Community Engagement Days ” was successfully launched. Organized by the Rural Institutions, Services and Empowerment (RISE) team of the Inclusive Rural Transformation and Gender Equity Division of FAO, in collaboration with the government of Belgium and thanks to the support of Resource Partners of the Flexible Multi-Partner Mechanism ( FMM ). The first event showcased the rationale behind community engagement for empowerment approaches, and their potential impact on achieving inclusive rural transformation. The virtual series of webinars has the main goal of reviewing the achievements, potential and challenges of community engagement for empowerment in development and humanitarian interventions and strategies. Moderated by Marcela Villarreal, Director of the Partnerships and UN Collaboration Division, the event welcomed Professor Robert Chambers from the Institute of Development Studies (IDS), University of Sussex, as the keynote speaker. In his presentation, Professor Chambers discussed the essential role of participatory approaches and people-centered development. He emphasized the importance of looking within communities, as communities are not homogenous, and addressing power dynamics and pre-existing biases. In his concluding remarks he strongly encouraged participants to “Search and share, and beyond that, innovate… Innovate and share what you innovated.” In his opening remarks, Maximo Torero Cullen, Chief Economist of FAO, welcomed participants and emphasized the importance of overcoming inequality to address some of the most complex challenges that lay ahead in a post-pandemic world and achieve the ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development . He stated that \"Inequality is a structural challenge that we need to overcome: there is no way we're going to achieve sustainably SDG1 and SDG2 if we don't touch on reducing inequalities.” His Excellency Frank Carruet, Ambassador, Permanent Representative of Belgium to the United Nations Rome-based Agencies (RBAs), stressed the importance of multi-partner pooled funding mechanisms, such as the FMM, to achieve catalytic impacts and leave no one behind. H.E. Frank Carruet highlighted the importance of programmes, such as the Dimitra Clubs, which promote community engagement and collective action, with special attention to the most vulnerable (especially women, who are often the hardest hit by inequality). Following his speech, Evariste Bushabu Bopeming, Secretary General, Ministry of Agriculture of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, applauded FAO’s deep commitment to fighting food insecurity and poverty and advancing the transformation of sustainable food systems. In an inspiring speech by Professor Katherine Gibson of Western Sydney University , Sydney, Australia, discussed how community-based approaches to gender equality contribute to rural transformation. Internationally known for her research on rethinking economies as sites of ethical action. She further affirmed that “gender equity is a very lofty and worthy universal goal, but it has to be grounded in the real experience and desires of people if it is to produce real change.” The event also included a presentation by Ali Abdoulaye, Dimitra Clubs’ Expert in West Africa, who illustrated how, for over 10 years, the Dimitra Clubs have been empowering rural people to champion endogenous development within their own communities in sub-Saharan Africa. In his practical intervention, Ali Abdoulaye stressed that “approaches must be flexible and not static, and especially those who benefit from these approaches, should take part in building the approach so that they can own it. This is a key element in Dimitra Clubs”.

      "article_text": "©FAO/Alessandra Benedetti A unique collection by Italian-Haitian fashion designer Stella Jean and craftswomen from the mountains of Kyrgyzstan will be highlighted at Milan Fashion Week today. The collaboration is supported by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) through its Women’s Committee and the Mountain Partnership Products initiative, a global branding scheme promoting products from small-scale producers in mountain areas. The initiative builds resilience of mountain people, many of whom live with threats of climate change and are poor and marginalized. Stella Jean, a champion of ethical fashion, partnered with the Mountain Partnership Products initiative after being introduced by the FAO Women’s Committee to the work of the Kyrgyz women from Barskoon, a settlement at 1750 meters elevation in the northeast of the country. “When I saw the women's silk and felt work, I immediately knew that they are the backbone of eco-sustainable fashion. They are custodians of a circular economy which is equitable and has a low environmental impact,” Jean said. The women create carpets, wall hangings and silk-and-felt scarves using traditional feltwork handed down through generations. In 2017, with support from the Mountain Partnership Products initiative, they formed an artisan group called Topchu to produce and market products collectively. Thanks to the sales of their scarves around the world, the women have been able to boost their incomes, support their children’s education and expand their vegetable gardens. Inspired by the women’s products, Jean worked online amid a COVID-19 lockdown with a local designer based in Bishkek on a sustainable fashion collection featuring traditional Kyrgyz embroidery in feltwork. The women of Topchu then used the designs to create the items, before shipping them back to Italy. “All the garments are embroidered with designs in felt, an organic fibre integral to Kyrgyz culture and way of life. By preserving and promoting this centuries-old example of sustainability, we help safeguard cultural heritage and morph what was once a supply chain into a value chain,”says Jean. The women of Topchu will retain ownership of the designs and will be able to reproduce the fashion items and sell them directly, benefiting from the increased international exposure. Senior FAO Forestry Officer Yuka Makino, who is the Coordinator of the Mountain Partnership Secretariat, said: “This collaboration is a powerful example of how cultural heritage can be a driver of sustainable development in mountains. It also shows how partnerships with the private sector can bring innovative solutions.” Funded by the Italian Development Cooperation, the Mountain Partnership Products initiative promotes high-quality mountain products to improve small mountain producers' livelihoods. The initiative provides capacity development, enables access to new markets, and creates links with the private sector. The initiative is coordinated by the Secretariat of the Mountain Partnership, a United Nations alliance that works to improve livelihoods and manage resources sustainably in mountain communities. In developing countries, almost 350 million people living in the mountains are vulnerable to food insecurity – an increase from 243 million in 2000.

The forests of the basin include more than fifteen percent of the world’s remaining tropical forests and are home to over 250 different ethnic groups. The ultimate goal of this project is to maintain the forests and protect the millions of species living within them — including endangered gorillas, chimpanzees, and bonobos. In a 2020 interview, she shares a similar message about the need for diversity within the field of science and environmental change. When asked about lessons learned throughout her career, she said, “This is complex, planet saving work, and with it I have learned that deep humility is needed. We need to seek out others and other perspectives to get the job done.” Clara Baringo Fonseca, SiBBr Clara Baringo Fonseca is a biologist and Senior Analyst of the GEF-supported Brazilian Biodiversity Information System.

She initially found interest in global environmental issues while pursuing a bachelor’s degree in biology at the University of Barcelona. After completing a five-year program that covered a wide range of environmental issues, Clara decided to focus on climate modelling in order to better understand the impacts of climate change on conservation and management of natural resources. The GEF-supported project she is currently working on aims to understand and catalogue Brazil’s biodiversity in order to promote sustainable use of the nation’s natural resources.The project is now in its final phase and has launched a National Biodiversity Database to compile more than 200 biological collections and 15 million records on Brazillian biodiversity. When asked to reflect on what she’s learned about the success of managing conservation and environmental issues, Clara emphasized the importance of inclusion. She said, “We need to include all types of societies, minorities and communities, with dialogue as one of the most fundamental tools to improve the wellbeing of all.” Rocío Cóndor, FAO Climbing the Ventasso Mountain and collecting high altitude plant flowers in the UNESCO Man and Biosphere Programme (MAP) Reserve Appennino Tosco-Emiliano, Emilia Romagna Region, Italy.

      "article_text": "Meghan Grever, 26 January 2021 As awareness of gender issues in international and national arenas grows, policy-makers in fisheries and aquaculture are becoming more gender-sensitive and are beginning to address gender issues in the fisheries sector. Historically, the policy agenda has given priority to fish production or fish farming activities, of which men generally predominate, often glancing over secondary sector processing and marketing activities where women tend to play a large role. It is increasingly clear, however, that gender is a defining factor in the social and economic context that shapes how food value chains function. Gender norms influence roles and responsibilities of women and men and the division of labour and affect disparities in access to resources, credit, technology, training and knowledge. Gender norms therefore heavily impact the overall efficiency of the food value chain, including food loss and waste. An estimated 59.51 million people were engaged in the primary sector of fisheries and aquaculture in 2018. Most of those engaged in fishing and fish farming are located in developing countries, with the majority being small-scale, artisanal fisheries and aquaculture workers. This includes various types of employment, including full-time, seasonal, and temporary engagements. Although women accounted for just 14 percent of this workforce, many authors and non-governmental organizations (NGOs) report that this number rises to one out of every two workers being a woman when considering both the primary and secondary fisheries and aquaculture sectors. Gender studies have shown that women are often assigned to unstable, poorly paid or unpaid positions within the secondary sector that often go unrecognized. Women considerably outnumber men in processing and marketing activities in both large-scale fisheries (66 percent) and small-scale inland fisheries (54 percent). Women also hold a significant share of labour in small-scale marine (36 percent) and large-scale inland fisheries (28 percent). As well, case studies from Asia suggest women’s contribution is often much greater than men’s, with, for example, women representing 33 percent of the rural aquaculture labour force engaged in fish production (excluding post-harvest activities) in China, 42 percent in Indonesia and 80 percent in Viet Nam. When afforded appropriate technology and funding, women also act as small-scale entrepreneurs, focusing on household-level operations, and less on offshore or long-distance capture fisheries. In small-scale coastal fisheries, women are generally responsible for skilled and time-consuming onshore tasks, or they manage smaller fishing boats and canoes. As key actors in processing and trading, women are in a prime position to make sure that customers get more food of good quality at an affordable price and ensure that less food is wasted before it is sold and eaten. Along the west coast of Africa , for example, women are often the first purchaser of product from the harvester and take responsibility for ensuring fish is available throughout the year, especially during the lean season. The women thoroughly preserve the fish through methods of smoking, salting, and curing before selling the product locally. Being in this position, the women can, theoretically, influence the fisher’s behavior, such as the type and quantity of fish landed or on-board storage practices, as well as the consumers’ habits by proposing better quality products in the market. Evidence indicates that substantial post-harvest losses and contaminated fish products are the result of inefficient and unhygienic harvesting, transportation, and processing methods. Case studies show that these issues are particularly prevalent in small-scale systems, and often can be resolved by small changes. Despite technical advances and innovations many developing countries still lack adequate infrastructure, services and practices for adequate onboard and on-shore handling and for maintaining fish quality. As women outnumber men in fish post-harvest activities, they are uniquely positioned to impact and change the efficiency of the system. It is therefore crucial that policies and practices which close the gender gap in access to resources, credit, technology, training and knowledge are put in place, and thus empower women to directly contribute to improving food quality and safety and reducing food loss and waste. Women are essential users of fisheries resources and pivotal players in the fisheries sector and should be considered important agents of change. Women in fisheries need to be seen and acknowledged, gain equal rights and equal access to credit and technology, and have equal say in decision-making and policy processes. Recognizing the vital importance of gender equity in the fish value chain is essential to ensuring overall value chain efficiency and to reducing food loss and waste.

Efforts have long been underway to promote sustainable food systems which deliver quality food and nutrition for all, in ways that support economic development, deliver positive social outcomes, and protect the natural environment. Although progress has been made in identifying the direct causes of fish losses and quantifying their magnitude, loss reduction strategies have historically focused on technological solutions, overlooking the gender relations that are a primary factor in the social and economic context which shape the functioning of fisheries value chains at all levels. As the food system continues to evolve, it is essential that a gender lens is considered. It is estimated the 35 percent of the global harvest in fisheries and aquaculture is either lost or wasted every year. In terms or fish, food loss leads to a reduction in nutritional and economic value, and can potentially result in food safety issues, ultimately impacting food security, livelihoods, and the environment. Wastage rates have been estimated to be highest in North America and Oceania, where about half of all fish caught is wasted at the consumption stage. In Africa and Latin America, fish is mainly lost due to inadequate preservation infrastructure and expertise. Women make up about 47 percent of those involved in small-scale capture fisheries, and account for around 56 million jobs along the fisheries supply chain, mostly in activities like processing and fish trade. They are, however, mainly concentrated in the low paid or low skilled roles, and are excluded from the most remunerative markets and business opportunities. Learn more"

      "article_text": "Empowering young women and men entails supporting youth-led and youth-serving organizations in their capacity to represent and engage young people while strengthening their social capital. Globally there are estimated 1.21 billion people aged between 15 and 24, a number that will increase to 1.29 billion by 2030. In Africa only, more than 10 million young people are expected to enter the labour market every year for the next decade. This growing youth population, especially in developing countries, represents a great opportunity for harnessing a demographic dividend, but also economic and social challenges, which could lead to political instability or conflict. With the COVID-19 crisis exacerbating existing vulnerabilities of rural young women and men and inequalities, it is crucial to design inclusive and sound gender-responsive policies and legislation that support investments in employment creation, formalization and adoption of labor standards in rural areas, providing equal opportunities for them. It is also important to ensure youth access to quality jobs with decent working conditions, including a living wage, health and safety at work, on-the-job training and access to social protection.

This webinar gathered Parliamentarians and strategic partners from Africa and Asia Pacific, and other key stakeholders representing rural youth organizations and networks. The important role of youth is acknowledged at international level by the strong commitments made in both the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goal and the African Union Agenda 2063. As highlighted by Mr Robert Guei, FAO Sub-Regional Coordinator for West Africa \"inclusive transformation of rural economies and food systems will not be possible without young women and men\". In order to harness the possibilities offered by the demographic dividend, deliberate efforts are needed to empower young women and men through equal access to productive resources and services, as well as by providing them with decent employment and income-generating opportunities.

Kiflom, 24, was one of many who left in search of a better life. He set off in 2013, hoping to return with the start-up capital to set up a small business in his hometown of Atsbi-Wenberta, around 100 km from Mekele, the capital city of Tigray. He found work as a shepherd in Saudi Arabia, but his dream came crashing down around his ears when the Gulf state began cracking down on illegal migrants. In six months in 2017 alone, the Saudi authorities deported an estimated 70 000 Ethiopians. “It was a traumatising experience, as I had to leave all of my belongings behind,” he said. “I needed to rebuild my life from scratch.” Kiflom’s prospects improved, however, when he got involved in a pilot project that helps landless youth and women begin small ruminant fattening businesses. The project saw an opportunity for change in the strong correlation between poverty in Ethiopia and the lack of livestock ownership. Agriculture accounts for around 37 percent of Ethiopia’s Gross Domestic Product, according to the World Bank, with the livestock sector contributing approximately one‑third of this. The project combined training in productivity improvements with the strengthening of producers’ organizations and improved access to financial services, allowing people to set up sheep and goat fattening businesses.

Smoked fish is a vital source of food security, nutrition and income for many African coastal communities. In Côte d’Ivoire, the foodstuff is hugely popular and widely sold in markets. However, the traditional smoking method requires large amounts of wood, letting off choking clouds of smoke.

Their children also suffered health consequences, as they were often present as the women worked, either bundled up in wraps on their backs or playing by their sides. “If you have kids, and you don’t do this, how will you feed them or send them to school?” said Tia Florence, a fish smoker in Guessabo. “This is hell.” Realizing the women often have no other options for better working conditions, FAO – as part of a wider project to improve food security and empower women across Africa – teamed up with the Government in 2014 to create a better and safer fish smoking process.

      "article_text": "Understanding the link between gender and food loss in Africa’s fish value chains 11 December 2020, Accra - Both gender and food loss issues are well studied, but the link between them has often been overlooked. In Africa’s fisheries value chains in particular, gender relations are a primary factor in the social and economic context that shapes their functioning. They influence labour division, roles, and responsibilities and create disparities and inequalities in access to and control over resources, services, knowledge, and technologies. Gender therefore affects the value chain's overall efficiency and, consequently, food losses. Experts from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) recently met with representatives from the African Women Fish Processors and Traders Network (AWFISHNET), the African Union Development Agency (AUDA-NEPAD) and WorldFish for a virtual dialogue on further understanding the link between food loss and gender equality in African fisheries value chains. In his opening remarks, Manuel Barange, Director of the FAO Fisheries Division, said that tackling gender inequality and its relationship with food loss in small-scale African fish value chains is “a development priority. It requires a multi-stakeholder approach, involving small-scale value chain actors, development partners, and all those who can make a difference\". He also urged participants to adopt a gender lens in analyzing the economic, social and environmental impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic in fishery and aquaculture value-chains and said, “it is fundamental that such gender lenses become an integral part of ‘the new normal’ imposed by COVID-19\". Empowering women in fisheries and aquaculture Although one worker in two in fisheries and aquaculture is a woman, women are invisible in the industry and their work unrecognized and under-estimated. \"We need to increase our efforts to make women's and girls' contribution to fisheries and aquaculture much more visible,” FAO Deputy Director-General Maria Helena Semedo said. “It is crucial to work together to remove the gender-based constraints that prevent women from being empowered and thus prevent the fisheries and aquaculture sectors from reaching their full potential.\" Lauren Pincus from WorldFish and Suzanne Njeri from AWFISHNET shared their respective organization's experiences in the field. Suzanne Njeri highlighted the causes of food loss in African fish value chains such as the lack of skills on good handling and hygiene practices; poor access to credit, technology and appropriate facilities; poor infrastructure; and exclusion of women from decision-making. These can be mitigated through capacity development on best practices, technology and entrepreneurship, and creating an enabling environment that promotes gender equality and access to credit, infrastructure and services. She also emphasized the importance of partnership between the government and local and international organizations in capacity building, training and exchange of opportunities. Lauren Pincus said a recent WorldFish study in Zambia used gender transformative approaches to advance gender equality at the same time as value chain, food security and environmental outcomes. This approach allowed participants to openly engage in understanding gender first, followed by participatory action research to understand what works in communities. Women’s contribution to food security often overlooked Bernice McLean from AUDA-NEPAD provided the keynote presentation. She stressed how women’s contribution to food security, livelihoods, household incomes and local economy is significant, but often insufficiently recognized and undervalued. She further provided recommendations for gender and food loss considerations that include enabling policy environments for gender mainstreaming and to enable opportunities for women in intra-regional trade, circular economy approaches and to benefit from technology innovations. A background paper was also presented highlighting practical guidance and tools for integrating gender concerns into fish loss studies and planning and implementing reduction interventions. The paper interprets key elements of the 2018 FAO Guiding Note on Gender and Food Loss in Sustainable Food Value Chains , adapting it to the African small-scale fisheries context. It also takes into account the concepts developed in the FAO Small-Scale Fisheries Guidelines Gender Handbook . Empowering women in fisheries contributes to achieving Sustainable Development 12 – Target 12.3 (halving per capita global food waste and reducing food losses by 2030), and SDG 5 (Gender Equality). It will also accelerate the achievement of the Malabo Strategic Action Area 1, which targets establishing effective post-harvest loss reduction systems in Africa by 2025. The virtual dialogue sparked fruitful discussions on how gender should continuously be integrated into fish loss assessments, interventions, and strategies. In close collaboration with its partners, the FAO Fisheries Division in Rome and the FAO Regional Office for Africa will continue this initiative and further work to develop capacity on gender and food loss towards achieving sustainable fish value chains in Africa.

The Joint Programme also aims to raise awareness and understanding about the importance and relevance of GTAs for achieving gender equality and attaining food security and improved nutrition objectives. ‘The COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated the fragility of societies across the globe, presenting an unprecedented challenge to public health, production systems and economic development,’ warned Máximo Torero Cullen, Chief Economist, FAO. With so many countries in lockdown mode, unemployment on the rise and confinement restrictions, this has created a storm for what is now being called a shadow pandemic – a dramatic increase in gender-based violence – where women and children are its main casualties. Change patterns and perceptions ‘Specifically, we must provide rural women and girls with equitable access to productive resources and services, and equal engagement in planning and decision-making,’ added Máximo Torero Cullen. ‘This Compendium breaks new ground by exploring the experiences in changing gender-discriminatory stereotypes and mindsets. It showcases a wide range of available gender-transformative approaches and explains what needs to be put in place to scale them up.’ Dismantling discriminatory social norms and antiquated ideas about gender stereotypes can be done in a variety of ways as the Compendium shows. The unifying thread is that we need to have a paradigm shift in how to approach the issue. While approaches and tools may differ depending upon the context, one of the key elements is enlisting the engagement of men as allies not as enemies , to shift age-old perceptions and outdated concepts of masculinity and gender and embrace new behaviour models. Understanding and addressing social norms must come first before any behaviour can change. The Compendium highlights that gender transformative approaches address the underlying social norms, attitudes and behaviours that keep gender inequality firmly in place. The 15 good practices included in the Compendium address several different areas of gender inequality. They range from unequal workloads between women and men, to the absence of women’s voice in decision-making, to the unequal participation in rural organizations and to women’s unequal access to resources and gender-based violence. The overarching objective of these approaches is to first, shine a light on unfair biases in social or economic settings, formal or informal institutions, in discriminatory policies and laws, second, call for reflection on these deep-rooted social and gender norms and third, challenge the existing power dynamics and bring about a paradigm shift. The GTAs included in the Compendium facilitate change on many different levels, from the individual and household, to the group and community levels and upwards to institutions to change policies and laws. The examples in the Compendium show that these approaches are flexible: they can be adapted to different contexts, from mentoring poor households on a one-to-one basis to working with groups or communities. Begin with the end in mind The Compendium is clear about its goal. Gender equality is not only an end-goal but is also a means to a better future. When communities embrace gender equality, everyone has a better chance in achieving food security faster. Aimed at policymakers, government officials, donors, NGO and CSO staff, community leaders, facilitators and private individuals, and anyone who wants to bring about gender transformative change in their country, in their interventions, in their communities and households, which will empower rural women, men, girls and boys. This Compendium should also be required reading for anyone working to make food security, improved nutrition and sustainable agriculture (SDG2) a reality. ‘These approaches are key for building kinder and fairer rural communities, where men and women can work together as equal partners,’ concluded Máximo Torero Cullen.

Gender-based violence prevails as one of the most inhuman exploit throughout the world, it has no boundaries either national, social or economic. In the midst of the COVID-19 crisis, the gendered implications have highlighted the unequal impact of the pandemic. In Pakistan, women being essential contributors to economic and social sectors have been faced with less access to necessary resources, services, and time– factors that are hindering their productivity. With COVID-19 and other socio-economic and cultural factors, the multidimensional gender inequalities and gender gaps have exacerbated, giving rise to massive challenges across the country, striking on societies, economies and political systems. Women are immensely affected, as they are more exposed to health risks, loss of income, take on a larger share of unpaid care work and face a heightened threat of gender-based violence during social confinement measures. The pandemic has also overwhelmed the activity lists of women farmers, who run household obligations while ensuring a safe and sufficient food supply for their families and communities despite of being victims of violence and all kind of harassments. Raising awareness against gender-based violence has become more important than ever especially women living in rural areas are particularly vulnerable to violence because of their relatively weaker social position and lack of awareness about their legal rights.

Female world activists gathered today at FAO’s virtual tea to discuss ways to address gender-based violence within the context of women, peace and security. They shared insights on how to empower women for more sustainable agri-food systems and ultimately for a more resilient world. The last of this year’s VirtualiTeas, a series of events organized by FAO’s Women Committee, was held in support of the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence . The campaign, launched by the UN Secretary General on 25 November, aims to support women and girls around the world to stay safe and free of violence. The event was opened by FAO Director-General QU Dongyu. The FAO chief set up the FAO’s Women Committee, along with the FAO’s Youth Committee, upon assuming office to ensure that the contribution of women at all levels of the organization as well as the development of young talent at FAO is promoted. In his opening remarks, he alluded to the crucial role that women and girls can play in contributing to peace and stability if enabled to actively participate in the whole value chain of agri-food systems. The FAO Director-General called for necessary changes to empower women and girls in rural areas, stressing that the way women are treated indicates the level of civilization within one’s family, one’s community or an organization. “Let's walk the talk to build solidarity for a global, lasting peace,” he said.

      "article_text": "©FAO/Eleonora Fayzullaeva Mahbuba was carefully following the instructions of a traditional crafts master, looking from time to time at her cell phone which was placed on the table with the screen facing upwards: she had to make sure that her four children were okay. She had left them with her mother-in-law that morning and they agreed that if something happened, she would message her. Mahbuba’s husband and his father left for Russia some time ago to find better jobs and she had become the de facto head of the household until the men returned home. Even if the men had been at home, she would not have left the children with them, because of social norms that prescribe domestic chore roles to women. It is highly unusual for Mahbuba to be away from home and she only leaves once a month to purchase household goods. If forests are “dwindling”, how would the family survive on only a small, partial income from the sale of seedlings and fruit, and growing wheat and raising livestock? But this time was different – this time she went to the district centre to join a three-day masterclass with 25 other women from Matmon and Jovuz, the highest and remotest mountainous villages of Kitab district in Kashkadarya province, to learn carpet weaving and how to make woollen blankets, clothing and souvenirs. Since her marriage at 18, she has been unable to attend university or vocational school because of her sizeable workload at home – looking after the children, maintaining a supply of water for drinking and the cattle, keeping the house warm in the cold season and undertaking the many other domestic chores typical of an average rural woman in her neighbourhood. For Mahbuba’s community, the forest is the main source of income and survival. She still remembers her mom teaching her how to interact with the forest; details such as how to safely light a fire for cooking in the grazing areas and how to harvest Ferula smelly. Not much has changed since then, but recently when buying goods in the bazaar, she heard through a local municipality campaign that the forest is degrading due to the continuous use of wood in the winter and animal grazing. If forests are “dwindling”, how would the family survive on only a small, partial income from the sale of seedlings and fruit, and growing wheat and raising livestock? ©FAO/Eleonora Fayzullaeva FAO currently works with four pilot areas in Uzbekistan to sustain forests in mountain and valley regions and support the most vulnerable. FAO has introduced alternative and diverse income-generating activities for women to increase their family income, which in turn will decrease their dependence on grazing and illegal logging. Experts recommend that communities increase their engagement with local non-wood resources, for example, environmentally-friendly sheep wool. This is available in most households but is often not utilized, and in most cases, is simply thrown away or burned after shearing. The introduction of carpet weaving and blanket making using wool represents the revival of, and new directions for, traditional crafts. There is high demand on the market and in the developing ecotourism sector along the routes of the Great Silk Road. This is why Mahbuba and over 100 other women from the regions of Kashkadarya, Syrdarya and Namangan have learned to produce environmentally-friendly non-wood crafts. Women do not usually engage in formal relations with forest enterprises due to widespread stereotypes that perceive men as the main breadwinners. Although the legislation provides equal rights for both women and men to own property, there are significant gender disparities in land and real estate ownership. The majority of forest grazing ticket owners and contractors are men. ©FAO/Eleonora Fayzullaeva Family finances are accumulated in the hands of the elder male, usually a father-in-law, who controls the family budget and expenditure. Women are not visible in forest management in Uzbekistan either, and less than 20 percent of the State Forestry Committee’s professional staff are female, with an even lower percentage found in the forestry organizations. FAO works closely with the State Committee on Forestry to strengthen the country's gender equality commitments and is conducting comprehensive work on introducing gender equality principles into the institutional policy and legal frameworks that govern forest management. One of the biggest achievements is the development of the first long-term, budgeted Corporate Gender Strategy of the Committee, which includes the establishment of a gender coordinator position in each forestry enterprise. Sustainable forest management is inseparably linked with integrated area development, basic infrastructure development (water, energy and roads), the provision of high-quality social services and finally, the creation of jobs for women and men across the value chain. Thoughtful, knowledgeable and careful management of forestry, timber and non-timber resources, using forest-friendly approaches and technologies at all levels will bring benefits for all – for Mahbuba, other women, men and the world as a whole. *** Mahbuba’ story, and many more, are part of the quarterly FAO gender newsletter for Europe and Central Asia , launched this month.

      "article_text": "As COVID-19 exposed the vulnerability in our food system, this briefing underscored why empowering women and closing the gender gap is central to addressing global food security and why women need to be at the center of COVID-19 response efforts. Women are a critical force in agriculture and food systems worldwide. However, they are disproportionately affected by hunger and malnutrition. As producers, women have less access to resources, assets, and access to credit. To raise awareness about how empowering women brings us closer to our goals of eradicating hunger, ensuring food security and eliminating all forms of malnutrition, FAO North America and CARE USA hosted a virtual Congressional Briefing. The session featured Senator John Boozman of Arkansas, Congresswoman Chrissy Houlahan of Pennsylvania and experts from FAO, CARE USA, and the US Agency for International Development (USAID). “We cannot achieve inclusive and sustainable food systems, eliminate hunger and malnutrition, or achieve sustainable development without women’s empowerment and gender equity,” underscored Vimlendra Sharan, Director of FAO North America in his opening remarks. FAO estimates that if women had access to the same productive resources as men, they could increase yields on their farms by 20-30 percent, and this, in turn, could reduce the number of hungry people in the world by 12-17 percent, Sharan cited. “For every US$1 USD 1 we invest in women and food security, communities see a US$31 return on investment,” said Maureen Miruka, Director for Gender, Youth and Livelihoods at CARE USA. “Gender equality can unlock the potential of women farmers who are otherwise overlooked by the system.” Senator Boozman was pleased by the focus on women’s empowerment. “All of the data says that if you empower women, make it such that they do well, children do well, communities do well, states and countries do well,” said Senator Boozman.

The webinar was attended by nearly 300 participants who tuned in from the four corners of the globe. What made GTAs successful and what valuable lessons did these approaches hold for everyone working to achieve gender equality and food security? Speakers threw light on these pressing questions, sharing examples of good practices that seemed to stand the test of time. Conventional methods fall short Conventional gender-sensitive methodologies often have failed to create lasting change for rural women. “And the main reason is that they focus a lot on closing the visible gender gaps in access to resources, information, technology and credit, and the results of these kind of approaches can be very short term and not always sustainable” said Jemimah Njuki, Senior Program Specialist, IDRC. What is needed is the use of new approaches that unearth the root causes of persisting gender inequalities that perpetuate unequal power dynamics and relations, discriminatory social structures, and change the gender-blind legislative and policy frameworks hindering rural women’s empowerment and food security. Marjeta Jager, Deputy Director-General for the Directorate General for International Cooperation and Development of the European Commission explained that the EU will be working hard to integrate gender in all of the EU’s external actions, “We aim to reach a proposed 85% target of gender-responsive new programmes and scale up actions targeting gender equality and women’s empowerment as their main objectives.” “There is no doubt that the transformation of food systems requires the true empowerment of women” , underlined Gabriel Ferrero y de Loma-Osorio, Director General of Sustainable Development Policies at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, European Union and Cooperation of Spain, and added, “It is essential to recognize the direct relationship between SDG2 and SDG5, and this must be central to the upcoming Food Systems Summit in 2021.” Changing the rules of engagement “Gender transformative approaches are not just a tool. They are not just one methodology,” said Jemimah Njuki. “They are a suite of approaches and processes that seek to identify and address the underlying causes of gender inequalities, specifically, by paying attention to issues about power, but also the way gender inequality is institutionalised in norms.” “We must do more to address those social norms, attitudes, beliefs and value systems that lie at the heart of gender inequalities, impede women’s empowerment and have detrimental consequences not only for women, but also for households, communities, institutions, and food systems at large” , urged Benjamin Davis, Director, Inclusive Rural Transformation and Gender Equity Division, FAO. Steven Cole, Senior Scientist at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture explained how GTAs in a fishing project in Zambia yielded significant results to advance gender equality. The use of GTAs resulted in a significant change in gender attitudes and more women enjoying joint fishing gear ownership and participating in income generating activities from processing to trading of fish two years into the project. Shraddha Joshi Sharma, Managing Director of Mahila Arthik Vikas Mahamandal, the Women Development Corporation of the Maharashtra Women’s Development Agency, India, shared her experience from the IFAD-funded Tejaswini Rural Women Empowerment Programme “During our Programme, we have promoted practices such as welcoming girls from the day they were born to challenge the perception of girls as second-class citizens, and eating together to improve the nutritional status of all household members.” Engaging men as allies During the COVID-19 pandemic, economic stress and social isolation in some settings have fed into an increase of violence against women and increased their care burden. “One percent increase in unemployment in many parts of the world, translates into 0.5-1 percent increase in violence against women” , explained Gary Barker, CEO and Founder of Promundo. “More work is needed to understand these triggers and find ways to prevent gender-based violence.” Gary Barker reflected that the most successful way to engage men and boys was at the collective level. Enlisting leaders, systematically approaching men in groups – since men see, measure and judge themselves in relation to other men – and the use of humour were proven successful approaches to shift men’s antiquated ideas and attitudes on emasculation, and have them take up activities that they previously thought of as primarily female, such as child care, all of which has also resulted in the reduction of gender-based violence. Walk the talk Going forward, the development community, as gatekeepers of championing gender equality, must take care to also ‘walk the talk’. “Carrying out gender transformative development requires reflection and transformation within the development agencies themselves,” said Benjamin Davis. “This requires going beyond capacity strengthening and internal organizational learning, to changing mind-sets, shifting mental models, values and beliefs. It also requires political commitment starting at the highest level—the top.” “Spain has always been strongly committed to gender equality,” said Mr Gabriel Ferrero y de Loma-Osorio, and anticipated Spain’s forthcoming financial contribution to the preparation of the CFS Voluntary Guidelines on Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment in the Context of Food Security and Nutrition. Kawinzi Muiu, Director for the Gender Office, WFP, stressed the importance of collaboration. “We cannot do anything without partnerships. The funding of the JP GTA was made possible by our partner, the European Union, meanwhile countries such as Spain have partnered with the RBAs in supporting the CFS workstream on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment.” About JP GTA The JP GTA, implemented by FAO, IFAD and WFP and funded by the European Union, was launched in 2019 .

FAO HQ held a webinar on “Addressing the gendered impact of COVID-19: Experiences from Pakistan”. FAO and UN Women Pakistan participated as speakers to explore the gender and COVID-sensitive Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) activities of the two UN agencies. This event was part of a webinar series addressing Risk Communication and Community Engagement (RCCE) for COVID-19 prevention along the food value chain supported by the European Union, under the partnership programme contributing to the Global Network Against Food Crises, and the American People through the U.S. Agency for International Development. FAO Representative in Pakistan, Mina’ Dowlatchahi and Country Representative UN Women, Sharmeela Rassool presented the experiences and lessons learnt. Speaking at the webinar, Mina’ Dowlatchahi, highlighted that “FAO is raising awareness amongst rural women regarding the impact of COVID-19 on food and agriculture, value and supply chain, food prices and food security. 68% of rural women and girls in the labor force are employed in the agriculture sector in Pakistan, 19% are in paid employment in agri-sector whereas remaining are unpaid workers. She noted that “With COVID-19, the multidimensional gender inequalities and gender gaps have exacerbated, givingrise to massive challenges across the country, striking on societies and economies. Women are immensely affected, as they are more exposed to health risks, loss of income, and take on a larger share of unpaid care work and face a heightened threat of gender-based violence during social confinement measures”.

      "article_text": "FAO and African Union launch Regional Outlook on Gender and Agrifood Systems 28 October 2020, Rome/Harare – Agrifood systems cannot be transformed unless there is gender equality. That was the simple message underlying the launch today of a new report by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the African Union that puts the spotlight on women’s role in agrifood systems. The report, Leaving no one behind: A Regional Outlook on Gender and Agrifood Systems , was launched by FAO Director-General QU Dongyu and African Union Commissioner for Rural Economy and Agriculture Josefa Sacko at the 31 st Session of the FAO Regional Conference for Africa . “Rural women are the pillars of our food systems and agents of change for food security and climate justice. But they’re also disproportionately affected by poverty, inequality, exclusion and the effects of climate change,” UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina Mohammed said by video message at the launch. “This excellent report will make an important contribution to the (2021 UN) Food Systems Summit and to policies and strategies that empower rural women and girls in Africa,” she said. “According to the findings of the report we are launching today, we must step up our efforts to create an enabling environment for rural women’s empowerment and entrepreneurship in the agri-food sector,” Director-General QU said. “I am confident that our joint efforts will pave the way for a more empowered future for rural women and girls in Africa.” Leaving no one behind Commissioner Sacko commended the Director-General for the solid partnership and joint efforts to contribute to the evidence base for women’s empowerment. “When we talk about empowerment, we have to have a scientific evidence base to advise policy makers, and this report contributes to that effort,” Commissioner Sacko said. “Women play a substantial role in African agriculture, but it is not sufficiently appreciated or documented.” Based on a review of 40 country gender assessments of agriculture and rural livelihoods, the report provides an in-depth review of the challenges and best practices to empower women in priority areas of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Programme (CAADP) and the Malabo Declaration. The ways forward The report makes recommendations to promote gender equality and women’s empowerment to achieve the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals and the African Union’s Agenda 2063, including: Developing gender-sensitive and gender-targeted activities in food security, nutrition, and resilience. For example, programs that deliver money to beneficiaries through mobile phones help close gender gaps by overcoming mobility constraints and decreasing reliance on official documentation that women may find difficult to obtain. Scaling up female entrepreneurship and women’s empowerment in agribusiness. Several countries have set up specific funds for women-owned agribusinesses. For example, the Imbita Eswatini Women’s Finance Trust provides microloans for rural women with no collateral requirements and no requirement for a husband’s approval. To date, the fund has distributed EU 15 million. Ensuring public-private partnership is inclusive to women to enhance their participation in value chains. The challenges In Africa, women are the backbone of their households, communities and rural economies, as food producers, processors, and marketers. They usually lead nutrition decisions for the family. The dramatic effects of climate change coupled with the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic mean women face multiple challenges. The number of people suffering from hunger is rising, and women are more likely than men to be food insecure. Improving women’s status and harnessing their potential as “food heroes” will be critical to ending hunger in Africa, the report argues. The President of the Panafrican Farmers Organization (PAFO) Elizabeth Nsimadala agrees. She urged greater partnerships to address inequality. “In Africa, inequalities between women and men are among the greatest in the world,” she said via video message at the launch. “Together, we can improve the status of rural women.” Barriers we can remove together Women often have only tenuous access to land – farming with short-term agreements from family or traditional authorities. These fragile rights can disappear overnight, preventing women from planning ahead or engaging in long term conservation farming. Women benefit less from advanced agricultural processes and tools, agricultural services and training, and have less access to rural financing. They tend to use manual equipment, and purchase fertilizer less often. Women face barriers to participate in larger-scale and more remunerative value chains. They often lack knowledge on trade standards needed to expand their business, especially phytosanitary standards which involve specialized knowledge. With lower education rates and discriminatory legal environments, women lack access to opportunity, affecting the food security of themselves and their children.

      "article_text": "Entrepreneurs in Peru’s fisheries sector are seeing their businesses take off, with help from an innovative national programme supported by FAO and the World Bank. ©FAO/Jordi Vaque When Peruvian fisher, Karin Abensur, caught nearly 800 kilograms of fish early one morning five years ago, she calculated roughly how much she would earn. “I thought, worst case scenario, they would give me 6 soles (USD 1.76) per kilo,” Karin said. But when she returned to the port of Pucusana in central Peru, after four hours on the high seas, she was disappointed to be offered just 1 sol per kilogram – roughly USD 0.30. \"They told me to take it, because no one would give me more.” This captures a grim reality for many people, like Karin, who make a living in Peru’s fisheries sector. The market value of common species like spiny dogfish and angelshark, which are abundant along the Peruvian coast, is generally low. Fishing has always been Karin’s passion, but after studying marketing at university, she realised that she had to get creative if she wanted to turn her passion into a livelihood. Soon after, she started her new business: transforming fish that have a lower market price into sought-after products, such as fish that is cut and prepared for sushi. She was inspired by the Asian food trend taking Peru by storm. “There’s a boom of Asian restaurants in Lima,” Karin said, “Many people want to eat sushi, but some cannot afford it.” Her business, Karin Ecofish, teaches female workers to use innovative cutting techniques in order to create new products from the fish she captures. They are now skilled in making the intricate, Japanese-style cuts that fetch a higher price in the market. \"I am taking a chance and creating Asian-style cuts, but with bonito ,” she says, referring to a cheap locally caught fish that tastes similar to tuna. \"After casting out my nets, as I wait, I play the qena (a traditional Andean flute) to ask the apus (mountain spirits) to have a good fishing day,\" says fisherwoman Karin Abensur. ©FAO/Jordi Vaque. It’s not just restaurants that she wants to entice with her locally-sourced, sustainable fish, but local consumers too. To encourage more people to eat fish, she’s expanding her product range from sushi, training her workers to make fish nuggets and fish fingers for children and grill-friendly cuts for family gatherings. On the opposite side of Peru, in the Puno region, another innovative female-led aquaculture business has had equal success. About 4 000 metres above sea level on the shores of Lake Arapa, a small business named Truchas Arapa produces a striking red-coloured trout by extracting axtasantin, a natural dye, from the munida fish. This fish is a common bycatch that is often left to rot on the shores. By incorporating the dye into trout feed, the farmed trout changes colour so it is more appealing to consumers and has a higher market value, making it more profitable. The fish has proven so popular that one of Lima’s top restaurants now serves it. Reyna Callata is the commercial director of Truchas Arapa. She has always been involved in the aquaculture industry in the area and used to manage her family’s company, which produces and sells trout from different areas of the Cusco department. “We needed to take a leap and we want to continue growing. We were sure this unique trout, healthy and high in protein, would be in high demand, with fairer prices leading to new jobs for people in the area.” The technical side of the project is run by Marisol Churacutipa. She joined as a practitioner and rose to the position of Head of Production, responsible for processing the trout into product. For Marisol, the success of their female-led business is more than just economic. “Many people are proud to see that women can carry out a project not just at home, but on a bigger scale. One that is productive and creating job opportunities for the community for women, and also for men,” she said. These projects are just two of the 800 businesses selected to take part in the Government of Peru's Fishe ries and Aquaculture Innovation Program (PNIPA). Started in 2017 and financed by the World Bank, PNIPA was designed by FAO, and at the Peruvian government’s request, FAO continues to support this programme. This includes implementing a competitive grant scheme to fund innovative farming techniques, improving the governance of the fishing sector and making use of digital platforms to monitor the programme’s performance. PNIPA builds on the fishing communities’ ancestral knowledge, helping them safeguard their fishery resources, tap into new markets and create more sustainable livelihoods. The programme celebrates innovation, not only by supporting entrepreneurship but also by encouraging women, indigenous communities and young people to put forward their ideas and participate. The programme expects to support 2 000 initiatives by the end of 2022. Marisol Churacutipa and Reyna Callata have had success with their business, adding natural dye to give trout more flavour and value. ©FAO/Jordi Vaque However, the programme doesn’t just focus on the fishers themselves, it also builds networks between researchers, restaurants, entrepreneurs and experts to create a sustainable, profitable fishing and aquaculture sector across the country. Dennis Escudero, an FAO investment expert, notes the importance of PNIPA’s participatory approach: “The communities themselves are coming up with innovative solutions. The programme funds initiatives that arise from real needs in different supply chains.” Once a project has been selected through a competitive process, the recipients make an initial financial contribution and PNIPA funds cover the rest. This approach leads to greater involvement and ownership among the recipients. Alongside financing, the programme holds a wide range of workshops and events designed to improve skills such as marketing. Innovation, innovation, innovation: it is key to creating sustainable livelihoods in today’s changing climate and to achieving all of the Sustainable Development Goals . Taking traditional sectors, like fisheries and aquaculture, and supporting local entrepreneurs and innovative ideas has had an incredible effect in Peru and is improving the lives of women and men across the country.

      "article_text": "©FAO/Akmaral Sman Rural women face multiple challenges – from systemic discrimination in accessing land and natural resources, the burden of unpaid work, and inequality within the family, to a lack of infrastructure and services. They are often engaged in work that is insecure, poorly paid, or not covered by social protection and at risk of being forced into adult and even child marriage, as well as excluded from leadership and decision-making positions at all levels. On the International Day of Rural Women , FAO urges the recognition of women’s significant role in enhancing agricultural and rural development, improving food security, and eradicating rural poverty. In Europe and Central Asia, the status of rural women is the most advanced globally; however, gender-based discrimination persists in the region. The situation varies within the sub-regions, but in most countries, women living in rural and remote areas are more likely to suffer from discrimination and poverty. In Georgia, for example, 9–25 percent of rural advisory service employees are women. Still, according to UN Women, women in general are less informed about the rural advisory services than men are. In Uzbekistan, women earn about 40–47 percent less of what men earn. About a quarter of working women in Turkey (rural and urban) assume full responsibility for childcare. The majority of women are thus employed at home or part-time to balance out childcare with work. Kyrgyz women are underrepresented in political roles, despite their proportion among local government and municipal employees. Acknowledging the role of rural women, FAO continues to work with national and international partners, civil society, and beneficiaries in Europe and Central Asia. FAO has helped achieve gender equality at the policy and strategic level, as well as address gender gaps within the communities through women’s economic empowerment. ©FAO/Eleonora Faizullaeva; ©FAO Gender-responsive policy work To manage forests sustainably, women from forest-dependent communities should be involved, too. Realizing that, Uzbekistan , in close partnership with FAO, has introduced gender equality principles into policies and practices of forest management. A milestone achievement is development of the first-ever, long-term, budgeted gender strategy of the Forestry Committee, which established the Consultative-Executive Council and gender coordinators in each forestry enterprise responsible for gender strategy implementation. “Almost all women living in forests are interested in gaining knowledge and skills on new, alternative income opportunities and we, the state forestry organizations, try to engage them as much as possible, as women bring order, discipline, responsibility, reliability, and success,” said Rano Bozorova. “For us it is, ultimately, not only to improve the economic status of households, but also strengthen economic potential, women’s empowerment in the family and society, and encourage socialization and active participation in the life of their communities.” Rano Bozorova, the only female director out of 100 forestry organizations in Uzbekistan Gender-sensitive advisory services In Georgia ,extension specialists of the government’s Informational Consultation Centerare now familiar with FAO’s Gender and Rural Advisory Service Assessments tools as a practical guide for mainstreaming gender in extension work. One hundred and three specialists have been trained by FAO on tools to conduct gender analysis and identify the different needs of women and men farmers. “ We still think that agriculture is mainly men’s work and there is no space for women in it. I understood that this is a stereotypical thinking only after the gender training and realized that all of us could contribute to breaking these norms and improve women’s access to the information of extensionist,” said Iago Kochiashvili, chief specialist at the Informational Consultation Center, Georgia. “Many women smallholder farmers used to approach me about issues of home gardening, poultry, and greenhouse production, and only now have I realized that they are legitimate clients! I learned that women, for many reasons, have less opportunities to reach out to our services, and therefore, addressing their needs should be of the same priority as others.” Women’s entrepreneurship is supported in Azerbaijan . Three hundred rural women received on-the-job training offered by FAO, the Ministry of Agriculture, rural advisory services, and other partners in the field, to secure their income from activities promoting local food. Engaging the national media can help reduce gender-based stereotypes toward women’s entrepreneurship. These interventions will be complemented by training relevant national institutions on developing gender-responsive policies and programmes. ©FAO/Nozim Kalandarov A multi-country FAO initiative on integrated natural resource management in dry and saline areas in Tajikistan actively engages rural women to participate in locally-established farmer field schools, and places greater emphasis on ensuring the equal participation of women in local planning processes. Today, over half of rural women beneficiaries are directly engaged in project activities and many beneficiaries share their success stories to empower their peers. Awareness raising on preventing harmful practices Awareness raising campaigns advocate for the prevention of harmful practices, such as child and forced marriage or bride-kidnapping in Kyrgyzstan . FAO, together with the UN Gender Theme Groups and UN Women, support women and men community members to organize theaters, discussions, flash mobs, and sports events to prevent violence that stands in the way of economic and social development. “Every third woman in Kyrgyzstan has experienced domestic violence at least once in her lifetime, and those living in rural areas are the most disadvantaged – crisis centers have limited capacity and almost no shelter services exist for those who seek help. Forced marriages and bride-kidnapping are still acute and these harmful practices limit a lot of opportunities for rural women,” explained a Kyrgyz trainer on an anonymous basis. “We help women to gain skills in agriculture, but very often face challenges when our beneficiaries suffer from domestic violence or, suddenly, our best participant, a young woman, goes missing from the training due to issues of forced marriage – therefore, we always try to raise awareness and spread information of available services for women about such difficult situations.” The first International Day of Rural Women was observed on 15 October 2008. The idea of honouring rural women with a special day was put forward at the Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China, in 1995.

      "article_text": "International Day of Rural Women 14 October 2020, Accra – For International Day of Rural Women marked globally on 15 October, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is challenging people to make a difference for all rural women and girls, especially considering the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. In some African countries, containment measures related to the pandemic have affected rural women’s income-generating activities, reducing economic opportunities and access to nutritious foods, while also increasing women’s workloads and the risks of gender-based violence. “Building rural women and girls resilience and empowering them to be equal agents for development in Africa is an urgent imperative now more than ever,” said Abebe Haile-Gabriel, FAO Assistance Director-General and Regional Representative for Africa, ahead of International Day Rural Women. “The COVID-19 pandemic has made glaringly clear that while women play a key role inside the house through all the care and domestic functions they perform and outside through their contribution to rural households’ livelihoods, they often bear the biggest brunt of crises and are not consulted in reconstruction efforts,” he said. While rural women are often at the forefront of crisis response, leveraging their resourcefulness and creativity, as evidenced during the COVID-19 pandemic, they are often not at the table when it comes to decision-making. Building back better needs to include more rural women and girls and their organizations in planning and decision-making. Building rural women’s resilience This year’s International Day of Rural Women theme is “Building rural women’s resilience in the wake of COVID-19”. It aims to raise awareness of rural women’s struggles, their needs and their critical role in our society. In Africa, women are the backbone of their households, communities, and rural economies. They play essential roles in food production, processing, and marketing, in agrobiodiversity conservation and management, and they are the champions of nutrition. However, their potential as critical agents of change in fighting poverty, hunger and malnutrition still remains largely untapped due to the existing structural barriers and discriminatory social norms that restrain their decision-making power and leadership at various levels. Recent analysis jointly conducted by FAO and the African Union Commission (AUC) has highlighted that wide gender gaps exists in most targets of the Malabo Declaration, notably in terms of productivity including access to and control and ownership of land, post-harvest losses, food insecurity and nutrition, poverty, employment, and resilience to climate change. Lack of equal access to agricultural trainings, services and finance compound the problem. The results of this analysis, together with concrete recommendations for policy makers to accelerate action to close the gender gap in agriculture and rural development, have been condensed in the FAO-AUC report “Leave No One Behind. Regional Outlook on Gender and Agri-food Systems” which will be launched at the 31 st Session of the Regional Conference for Africa later this month. “Let’s not forget that in addition to removing the structural barriers that rural women and girls face, we need an equal if not stronger focus on changing the socio cultural norms and intersecting forms of discrimination that keep them at the margins of our society,” Jocelyn Brown Hall, Deputy Regional Representative and FAO Representative to Ghana said. “Only by putting women and girls at the centre of concerted efforts to build back better, by giving them voice and supporting them in decision making and leadership roles, we can say that we are serious about transforming our food systems to be more productive and efficient and more socially inclusive and just,” she said. While the pandemic has highlighted the potential of digital technologies and innovation, it has also become clear that rural women and girls are not and will not be in a position to benefit from digital innovation unless the existing digital gender gap is addressed. International Day of Rural Women is a call for all decision-makers in Africa to base their plans, strategies and policies on gender analyses and data and make sure that the policies, strategies and programmes equally benefit men and women in the fight against hunger and poverty.

      "article_text": "“There are many active struggles around the primary need to have land to grow on in the first place. That was, is, and continues to be our collective goal since before Emancipation” – Gail Taylor. Gail Taylor is the Owner and Operator at Three Part Harmony Farm, a small-scale agroecological farm in northeast Washington, DC. This small urban farm is on the ancestral lands of the Piscataway, Pamunkey, and Nacotchank Peoples. She established the farm to grow food for people, while creating a viable and just local food economy. She is a member of the Black Dirt Farm Collective with farmers, educators, scientists, agrarians, seed keepers, organizers, and researchers guiding a political education process. “My motivation, originally, was to learn more about where good food comes from and understand how produce finds its way from a farm to the grocery store,” said Gail. Working the land was a way for Gail to connect with her ancestors and be part of the Return Generation, bringing dignity and vibrant livelihoods back into food systems. “My great-grandfather saved money to buy the empty lot next to his house and became known for his tremendously huge garden. Somewhere in my subconscious, I think I knew that returning to the land would be a life-changing event for me,” she said. A tireless advocate for social justice issues, Gail led the three-year “ I Want DC to Grow ” campaign that resulted in the passage of the DC Food Security Act of 2014, also known as DC’s Farm Bill. The Act set the stage for Three Part Harmony and other urban farmers to grow commercially in the District by incentivizing the use of privately owned land for urban farming and community gardens. However, she explains the state still lags behind in the services that the Department of Agriculture provides to farmers in other states. Finding a connection with and having access to land, was crucial for Gail. She leases her two-acre plot from the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate for free. Once devoid of life, the pollinator-friendly farm now grows vegetables and herbs on half an acre and flowers on an eighth acre. Gail runs a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) program with 170 members in partnership with two Black woman-owned farms. “We add in flowers, mushrooms, grains, fruit and honey from less than half a dozen other farms and, in addition to working with farms that are committed to sustainability, we always prioritize working with farms that are owned by People of Color and/ or women or gender non-binary folks,” she said. Her dedication doesn’t come without its challenges. “Growing vegetables in DC is not a profitable enterprise by any stretch of the imagination. I have always had a part-time job to support myself while doing this work,” said Gail. In June alone, Three Part Harmony Farm donated thousands of pounds of fresh produce to a church in Towson, Maryland, and a small grant made it possible for them to deliver hundreds of pounds of produce to a mutual aid food distribution group within walking distance of their farm. “I hope this awareness around sourcing locally, and these unique partnerships will continue long after a vaccine is developed. COVID-19 did not create food apartheid in our city. What it did was increase awareness and perhaps increase empathy among those who had never known food insecurity before,” said Gail. This food hero is promoting pathways for people to have access to public and private lands to grow food to nourish people in urban areas, while shortening the distance from farm to fork."

      "article_text": "Margaret Nakato speaks with the Baja Basaga women’s group about women’s rights and engagement in the Nile perch fishery at the Kibanga landing site in Uganda. ©Katosi Women Development Trust Margaret Nakato is a woman with a vision: gender equality. She has made it her mission to empower the women who rinse, prepare and sell fish from Ugandan lakes to local markets. Africa's inland small-scale fisheries sector, centred around the large lakes across Uganda, is an important source of employment for local communities. Whilst the fishing itself is still very much a male domain, when it comes to the processing, preparing and selling, it is estimated that 69 percent is done by women. However, in order to prepare and sell fish products, they have to negotiate with the predominantly male fishers to get access to the freshly caught fish. The women are also competing with wholesale buyers who offer much higher prices. Many women face violence and threats on a daily basis. Margaret is adamant that women are integral to the fishing sector and is on a mission to help women recognise this fact and use it to their advantage. “The women I meet at the fish landing sites around Lake Victoria don't recognise that they have a right to be in fisheries,” Margaret says. “They feel at the mercy of fishermen. That’s why we must inform them that they have rights!” Support through women’s groups Margaret is a coordinator at the Katosi Women Development Trust (KWDT) in Uganda, a non-profit organization financially supported by FAO, that assists 691 women from 29 women’s groups. Many of them are food producers in small-scale fisheries. Women working independently often face harassment from male community members and enforcement officers. KWDT encourages the local women to form groups, as a way of strengthening women’s voices and helping protect them from violence. In a group, women are less vulnerable. Perpetrators think twice when they know that they are not dealing with an individual, but a woman who belongs to a group, especially when that organization has the resources to protect her rights. Groups also encourage and support women, whose rights have been violated, to report the crimes. They work together to access legal information on their rights, in fisheries or other sectors. Left/top: Training sessions teach the women more modern fish-smoking methods to improve their health and safety. Right/bottom: Margaret helps the women empower themselves through education and knowledge of their rights. ©Katosi Women Development Trust Training and technology Margaret regularly goes to the fish landing sites to conduct training sessions for these women’s groups. The sessions focus on conflict management, advocacy and human rights, as well as technical methods to help improve the value of their products. After FAO supported Margaret’s participation in a training on fish smoking and preparation methods, she has run other training sessions on how to hygienically handle fish during processing and how to smoke fish safely using new technology, which reduces exposure to harmful fumes. “Through forming the women’s groups, we have managed to support women’s access to training and appropriate technology in food production and processing. Autonomy, empowerment and independence don’t come overnight, but through a series of activities, we have boosted the women to take charge of their own development,” Margaret says proudly. These groups have also helped the women get better access to microcredit and invest in new equipment. Eleven women’s groups have been able to buy new fish drying racks and five a safe fish smoking kiln. With the skills and new technology acquired, women are able to produce higher quality fish products that can fetch better prices, reduce their post-harvest losses and increase their incomes. Aftermath of COVID-19 KWDT’s initiatives proved invaluable when COVID-19 hit. At the beginning, Margaret raised awareness about the risks of the pandemic and how the local women’s groups could protect themselves and their businesses during the difficult period. Sadly, due to the lockdown, many women were forced to stop working and have now lost their main source of income. In order to help keep their families fed, KWDT has established a fund to support women in reviving their small businesses, which are their main source of income for food and other basic needs. FAO’s country office in Uganda has close ties with KWDT and regularly meets with its group members - without this collaboration, Margaret says that it would have been much harder for KWDT to reach the communities it now supports. Food hero Margaret speaks passionately about boosting women’s role in food production. ©Katosi Women Development Trust With FAO’s support, Margaret has attended various global meetings over the last five years in order to raise the voice of small-scale fishery workers. She is positive and passionate about improving conditions for women in Uganda’s fisheries. Why? Well, as she says, “When you empower women food producers you improve not only their lives, but the food production of entire communities.” FAO believes that the actions of food heroes like Margaret, who are dedicated to boosting women’s role in food production and improving gender equality, are essential for food security, nutrition and the achievement of all the Sustainable Development Goals. As Margaret says, it won’t happen overnight: but awareness, training and opportunity are the steps that will get us there. Behind all of our food, there is always someone who produced, planted, harvested, fished or transported it. In the run up to World Food Day on October 16, we take the opportunity to thank these #FoodHeroes who, no matter the circumstances, continue to provide food for their communities and beyond - helping to grow, nourish and sustain our world.

      "article_text": "Once shy and reserved, Maria Rebeca is now passionate about sharing her knowledge with others, holding workshops attended by many members of the local community. ©FAO/José Itzep Raising a family from a young age, María Rebeca Perez de Nebaj has always had to be self-reliant. She is part of the Ixil indigenous community living in the Quiché department of Guatemala. The indigenous communities in this area have suffered from armed conflict and violence in recent history. As a result, livelihood opportunities are lacking in the region – particularly for indigenous women. Initially Maria Rebeca worked in agriculture on a small farm, but at 19, she bought a sewing machine and quickly mastered the art of embroidering and sewing huipiles , the traditional garment worn by indigenous women in Guatemala. This source of income was crucial for her household, made up of her parents and her two children, where she is the main breadwinner. But whilst her sewing allowed her to cover part of her family’s expenses, it was not enough to keep her family well-fed. Her income barely covered three meals a day, and she worried that her children’s diets were not nutritious enough to keep them healthy. She toyed with the idea of moving to the north of Guatemala in search of work, but as a single woman alone, it would have been difficult and dangerous. However, when she heard about the FAO-led Ixil Joint Rural Development Programme beginning in her area, she recognised an opportunity to stay with her family and learn an agricultural trade. What a difference a garden makes The FAO programme, aimed at improving the livelihoods and nutrition of the indigenous communities in the area, taught Maria Rebeca how to produce nutritious food through her home garden. She began by learning to build small greenhouses and grow tomatoes, which visibly improved her children’s nutrition. With what she produced in her garden, she was able to guarantee three square meals a day for her whole family. After the initial training, Maria Rebeca took part in another on poultry farming, taking her knowledge and income to the next level. She began with just one rooster and one hen that laid three eggs a week – now, she has close to 1 000 hens in her large back garden and has a thriving business. She makes around USD 900 a month from the eggs and is renowned in her area and nearby communities for the quality. Maria Rebeca is also the only participant of the FAO training to have formally signed up as a supplier to the school food programme, and before the pandemic she was providing local schools with 600 eggs per week. Now she sells them directly to her community and in local markets. Maria Rebeca’s confidence has soared with the successes of her work. Her tomatoes are thriving in the newly built greenhouse, and she now earns a solid income from her chickens. ©FAO/José Itzep A leader in her community The FAO programme not only taught her new skills but kindled in Maria Rebeca a sense of self-esteem and confidence that she had never felt before. She had always been shy and unassuming; participating in community events was difficult and speaking in groups even harder. But her newfound knowledge has given her the confidence she needed to be a promoter of the programme, sharing her new skills with other men and women in her community. Her new role did take some getting used to however. “At the beginning, I felt scared because it was the first time that I assumed a role within my community. There were some families that said that I could not be a promoter because I had no experience, since I was very young. But I took it as a challenge. Now I see that people trust me and respect me in the community,” María Rebeca says. Maria Rebeca now grows enough food to give her family three meals a day – and before COVID-19, supply a local school too. ©FAO/José Itzep Maria Rebeca has attended all of the training courses run by FAO and Guatemala’s Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food, and thanks to her perseverance and knowledge, she has helped fight the stigma that many people in her town of Pulay felt towards women. She has become a role model for many other women in the community. In a short period of time, Maria Rebeca has gone from a shy young girl to a local food hero. A local expert on egg and tomato production, she is a source of inspiration for other women and her patience and capacity to teach others has had a huge impact. “FAO and the Ministry have helped me increase my productivity in the small plot of land that I own, but even more than that, they have helped me to dream big. I want what’s best for my children, that is why I am working towards new and more ambitious goals,” she says. María Rebeca’s household is one of the more than 2 100 that have taken part in FAO’s project in the region, implementing better practices to increase food production, diversifying incomes and ensuring a more nutritious diet for families. Together with local communities and inspiring #FoodHeroes, FAO is helping to build stronger livelihoods, improve nutrition and make hunger a thing of the past. Behind all of our food, there is always someone who produced, planted, harvested, fished or transported it.

      "article_text": "Iroshini Seneviratne Manike (Centre) on a field visit to the home garden of Nisansala Lakmali (Right) and Sumith Bandara (Centre left). ©FAO/Tharindu Rajapaksha When Sumith Bandara and Nisansala Lakmali decided to start home gardening, they had visions of plump vegetables, juicy fruits and aromatic herbs nestled in a lush garden. On an abandoned plot of land adjacent to their home, the couple started the project with only a little bit space and a sprinkling of knowledge, but their visions took seed. Making their dream a reality, though, was not that simple. “I soon realized that you can’t plant a seed and expect it to grow without proper care or attention,” said Sumith. That’s where Iroshini Seneviratne Manike, the village’s Agriculture Production and Research Assistant, came in. “She closely supervised and advised us about simple technologies for soil fertility improvement and suitable crops for a shady environment. She also connected us to FAO and other extension officers in the Department of Agriculture. Our knowledge and confidence improved.” Nisansala and Sumith, who live in the Nawa Gurukale village in the Kandy district, are among the 150 beneficiaries who received capacity building and inputs from FAO. In partnership with the Ministry of Environment and Wildlife Resources, this FAO project promotes sustainable land management in the Sri Lanka’s Central Highlands through land restoration technologies and best practices. Land degradation due to soil erosion and decline in soil fertility are major issues in these central areas of Sri Lanka, with 50 percent of agricultural lands degraded. The project, funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF), intended to change that. With this support, Sumith and Nisansala have seen their home garden prosper, boasting a wide variety of crops such as yams, tomatoes, chilies, long beans, herbs, leafy vegetables and fruits including passionfruit, avocado, mango and durian. For Iroshini, there is no greater source of satisfaction than to see the advice and guidance she offers bear fruit, literally! “During my 21 years of field experience, I have found that a home garden is a great source of nutrition for the whole family and also a means to earn an income,” said Iroshini. Iroshini lives by what she preaches and maintains her own home garden. The garden, devoid of any chemicals and pesticides, helps her ensure that her three children have healthy food that is safe to consume. She advocates this to rural families, especially to parents who can relate to wanting what is best for their families. Home gardens took on new importance during the COVID-19 crisis. This source of food and self-sufficiency was vital to rural families during the lockdown. ©FAO/Tharindu Rajapaksha A lifeline during COVID-19 As COVID-19 hit, the garden as a food source and self-sufficiency took on new importance. “Our home garden was an asset when the COVID-19 crisis unfolded,” states Nisansala. “We know the food is grown safely, which makes it more nutritious too.” During the lockdown period and island-wide curfew, Nisansala and her family had homegrown vegetables and fruits for their meals. “It was useful not only for our family but for our neighbours too. Sometimes when there is excess, we sell it to local vendors, or we distribute it to our neighbours and relatives.” As a food hero during this crisis, Iroshini provided critical assistance to the community. With imports of certain food items being restricted, Iroshini and other agrarian and agriculture extension officers had to support the local production of crops such as mung-beans, cowpea, groundnut, maize, chilies, onions and turmeric to meet the food requirements in the country. “There was not a single day that I spent at home. We were categorized as essential service workers. Although we could not initially engage in field visits to the communities we serve, I provided constant advice over the telephone to ensure that the home gardens were functioning smoothly,” said Iroshini. For those families, who wanted to start new home gardens and had no prior experience, Iroshini and the other officers gave them particular attention and, when the COVID movement restrictions eased, they even undertook visits to their homes. “We followed the health guidelines and we informed the households to take the necessary health precautions such as wearing facemasks, gloves and maintaining physical distancing,” explains Iroshini. The Ministry of Agriculture also initiated a national home gardening project with the aim of developing one million home gardens in Sri Lanka to ensure household food security during COVID-19. Willingness and patience are the main ingredients for a successful home garden, according to Nisansala. ©FAO/Tharindu Rajapaksha Family and community bonding The home garden has provided other benefits too like family bonding and teaching children about the work that goes into producing food. With schools closed due to COVID-19, Sumith and Nisansala’s three children also help with the garden. The children eagerly record each step of plant growth, from planting to harvesting. “Our children have gained so much knowledge and awareness about the environment... By observing the growth and changes in the plant, and later in understanding that the crops they care for ultimately end up on their plate and provides the nutrition they need to lead a healthy life has fuelled a deep respect for the environment and those who produce food,” describes Sumith. Nisansala and Sumith now happily give advice to neighbouring families who want to set up their own home gardens. As for Iroshini, she sees her job more broadly: “I don’t see myself only as an Agrarian Service Officer to the rural communities, I also serve often very poor farming families. I try to be a friend who listens to their problems and motivates them to develop their lives. Giving them hope that no matter how poor you are, you can still stand on your own feet with determination and take care of your families. It can even start from home,” says Iroshini. In collaboration with food heroes, like Iroshini, FAO supports rural communities to maintain not only their livelihoods and food security but also their self-sufficiency during crises. Resilient communities who can provide for themselves are key to a world without hunger. Behind all of our food, there is always someone who produced, planted, harvested, fished or transported it.

      "article_text": "A kind gesture by entrepreneur and food hero, Keti, helps other women through the COVID-19 pandemic A valuable encounter at an FAO -organized study tour last year gave Keti Tomeishvili, a Georgian vegetable producer, the lucrative idea of growing culinary herbs alongside her cucumbers. This opportunity, coupled with high demand for herbs in neighbouring Russia, has really paid off. Now this extra income is not only helping Keti during these difficult times brought on by the pandemic, but she is also able to help other women in her community. Keti hails from Imereti in western Georgia. She initially began her business in 2017 by growing cucumbers in greenhouses. In this part of Georgia, greenhouses don’t require much heating in winter, making them an affordable option to grow produce all year round. They provide protection from colder weather, while also reducing the need for chemical fertilizers. The result is good quality produce with a longer shelf-life. Hard-working and energetic, Keti has invested in improving her business over the last couple of years – from drip irrigation to good quality seeds and better pest management. In 2019, Keti travelled to Ukraine and the Netherlands with a small group of Georgian and Moldovan fruit and vegetable growers to see the latest in greenhouse production trends and technologies. The study tour, supported by the European Union’s EU4Business initiative, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and the Government of the Netherlands, was organized by FAO in cooperation with the Netherlands Enterprise Agency. It was part of a larger FAO-EBRD initiative to help fruit and vegetable growers in Georgia, Moldova, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan modernize their operations to tap into more lucrative markets. The study tour gave Keti a chance to learn more from her peers and leaders in the greenhouse industry and make valuable business contacts – from input suppliers and wholesalers to innovative producers. One such contact, also part of the group, was Goderdzi Shavgulidze, head of the Georgian herb cooperative Kvitiri , a big exporter of culinary herbs. At the time, Keti’s greenhouse business only produced cucumbers for the local market. But after meeting Goderdzi and seeking out his advice, she set aside a section within her 2 000 square metres of greenhouse space to grow coriander. The Kvitiri cooperative then helped her sell the herbs. Her decision to diversify came at the right time. It opened up new markets and boosted her earnings, helping her to cope better with the pandemic’s economic shocks and putting her in a better position to support fellow workers in her community. Keti managed to produce and export three tonnes of coriander to Russia in March despite the logistical challenges and transportation restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. Heavy snowstorms further complicated the situation. An avalanche just prior to this health crisis closed parts of Georgia’s border with Russia for about a week. Keti’s feat was that much more impressive. Although she earned less than she had hoped, she still made enough to continue paying the four women who work in her greenhouse, but was unable to increase their salaries to compensate for rising food prices and a devalued currency. So Keti decided to let them use one of her five greenhouses to grow cucumbers. “The harvest in this greenhouse will come in three weeks, and I will help them sell it,” she says, adding that the women will keep the profits, cushioning their salaries a little. “These women and their families have had a hard time, and I can afford to go without this profit for several months,\" she explains. To date, the FAO-EBRD initiative has supported more than 20 market-oriented activities for fruit and vegetable growers in the four countries, sparking new investment interest in modern horticultural production. With the COVID-19 crisis creating uncertainty and hardship, FAO and the EBRD are trying to provide the most up-to-date market information possible, through widely used platforms, to help producers and agribusinesses navigate this new reality. These difficult times have also inspired countless acts of kindness and solidarity, like Keti’s to her employees, or the Georgian Dairy Association’s regular donation of dairy products to the infectious disease hospital in Tbilisi to support COVID-19 patients who are treated there. “We have to help each other,” Keti says. “I believe kindness is contagious.”"

Today, FAO seed and tools distributions are more essential than ever for the country’s vulnerable communities, as are the dedicated humanitarian workers, like Ritah, who keep FAO’s operations up and running. She is a food hero and a real life hero – like many others in the humanitarian community worldwide – working with passion and dedication to ensure that communities maintain their livelihoods and stay food secure, despite natural disasters, insecurity, desert locusts or COVID-19.",
      "article_text": "Having moved to Uganda to escape the civil war, Ritah decided to return to South Sudan to help her new country and fellow citizens. Working in logistics with FAO, she now helps provide livelihood support to those in need. ©FAO/Mayak Akuot Ritah Alfred was born near Juba when South Sudan was still the southern region of Sudan. In 1993, she escaped the civil war that eventually led to the creation of the world’s newest country. Travelling with her family to Uganda at the age of 4, Ritah was then raised by her uncle and secured a good education, finally enjoying a safe and comfortable life. Ritah could have stayed in Uganda. Instead, as soon as she graduated from university, she returned to South Sudan to help build her new country. “I wanted to return because I love my country, and I am proud to be South Sudanese. I strongly believed that I have a role to play to bring peace and development, so I also returned to make a difference and change in my community,” she says. Ritah first encountered FAO when working for a local custodial company hired to keep the agency’s offices in Juba clean and orderly. She was impressed by the work she saw taking place. When a staff opportunity opened up on the team that manages the delivery of agricultural supplies to families in need, Ritah went for it and got it. South Sudan is not always an easy place to work, in any sector, and humanitarian work is notoriously tough – safety concerns, cultural constraints, poor infrastructure. These are just some of the hurdles that humanitarian workers, in particular female humanitarian workers, face. From supervising suppliers and keeping warehouses stocked to coordinating the loading of trucks and managing lifesaving items like seeds, Ritah is challenging the status quo as a woman working in logistics, a field that has been largely dominated by men. And Ritah soon faced an additional challenge -- the start of her new assignment essentially coincided with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic. But she’s definitely up to the challenge. Ritah quickly adapted to the new reality. While some of her colleagues are working from home, she remains on the front line, ensuring the continuity of FAO operations in South Sudan. “When COVID-19 was discovered, I was anxious, and I was feeling unsafe, but since I was trained on safety precautions, I’ve adopted the new measures of keeping safe not only myself but also the people around me,” she says.

This in a country where 6.5 million people were already coping with acute food insecurity before the virus hit. Today, FAO seed and tools distributions are more essential than ever for the country’s vulnerable communities, as are the dedicated humanitarian workers, like Ritah, who keep FAO’s operations up and running. When Ritah arrives each morning at 8 am she sanitizes her hands and makes sure all her colleagues do the same. Then she starts working, checking the stock of items to ensure that each consignment is loaded according to release orders. Ritah’s office is the FAO warehouse in Juba. From here, seeds, farming tools and other important agricultural inputs are dispatched to the most remote areas of the country where vulnerable people still need basic inputs, like seeds, to survive. The facility is located a few hundred metres from the international airport and serves as FAO’s main logistical hub inside South Sudan. Fifty people, including managers, security guards, logistic assistants and cleaners are constantly at work to ensure seeds and farming tools are stocked, distributed and received across the country. Thanks to innovative ways of working and adapting, FAO has been able to distribute over 9 million kilograms of seeds to farmers in South Sudan for the 2020 main planting season, despite the constraints imposed by COVID-19. “We are still managing to work, and the seeds are moving every day and everywhere. Using digital platforms and tools, we are in constant touch with warehouses in Aweil, Bor, Juba, Kapoeta, Maban, Rumbek, Torit, Wau and Yambio,” Ritah explains. Needs are not only limited to the countryside. COVID-19 associated disruptions to food chains are affecting city dwellers in South Sudan too. FAO’s vegetable gardening project improves food production and supports the nutrition and income of poor urban households, helping to mitigate the impact of COVID-19 on food security. Rita and the many other heroes in the humanitarian community are working with dedication to ensure that communities stay food secure and maintain an income, despite natural disasters, conflict, desert locusts or COVID-19. ©FAO/Mayak Akuot Ritah is proud of this work – her family is too, despite worrying sometimes. “My mom video calls me every evening to check that I am fine. She always reminds me to wear a mask and take regular tests for coronavirus.” While the world works to combat COVID-19, there are many other pressing issues it cannot ignore. In South Sudan, FAO’s core goal is to tackle the root causes of food insecurity. Through her work, despite challenging circumstances, Ritah is helping achieve this goal, one day at a time. She is a food hero and a real life hero – like many others in the humanitarian community worldwide – working with passion and dedication to ensure that communities maintain their livelihoods and stay food secure, despite natural disasters, insecurity, desert locusts or COVID-19. Ritah sees a bright future for her country. “Things will change in South Sudan. I strongly believe that together we’ll be able to fight the root causes of food insecurity. With FAO, we are doing our best to help the most vulnerable people, also helping them to learn good ways to farm and get the best produce. A striving agricultural sector is crucial to development and peace,” she says. Learn more"

Munthali The Nkhotakota district of Malawi is nestled between the sandy shores of Lake Malawi and the country’s largest wildlife reserve. Agriculture is one of the biggest industries and many communities live off the land. Farmers often grow rice, maize and cassava, the traditional crops of the area, as their parents and grandparents did before them. However, if you gaze out at the land surrounding Kakowa village, you’ll see something a little different: a sea of spiky, green pineapple crowns. So how did this community come to break with tradition and start farming the tasty, tropical fruit so many of us know and love? In essence, the community was struggling to make an adequate income on the yields from traditional crops like rice and maize. Tabiya Jafali, a mother of three young children, recounts, “I had been farming rice for years and had very little return over the years. It was increasingly difficult to meet my children’s needs at home and to have enough money for school fees.” A little while ago, however, Tabiya heard about the Farmer Field School (FFS) in her area. Thirty women and 12 men were enrolled in the group, which is supported by FAO and the Government of Malawi under the European Union-funded project, KULIMA short for Kutukula Ulimi m’Malawi , which translates to “Promoting farming in Malawi”. The project aims to strengthen the farming knowledge of communities and empower them to transition from subsistence agriculture to a more productive and commercially-oriented agriculture. Back in April 2019, members of FAO’s Chitontho FFS decided that they had to make a change in the way they farmed. They looked around for a viable farming enterprise that would allow them to boost their incomes and heard about a similar group of farmers who had tried something new: pineapple farming. Pineapples aren’t a common part of the diet in Nkhotakota, despite Malawi being a tropical country, but the FFS group learned that it was profitable. Being encouraged further by the government’s District Agriculture office, the Chitontho FFS group made a unanimous decision to grow pineapples. “We had to try something different. We had to try something that would bring in a good amount of money for us as farmers,” states Rhamadani, the facilitator and chairperson of the Chitontho FFS. Looking out from Kakowa village, there is a sea of spiky green pineapple heads. ©FAO/T. Munthali From then on, the members attending the FFS were farming with a purpose and that was income and nutrition security for their households. Fast forward to today, nearly a year later, they say that their initial confidence is unwavering and their progress steady. Since planting, the group has learnt a lot about farming the spiky fruit. Ethel Mwase, who supports the group as their Agriculture Extension Development Coordinator, says that the FFS’s “learning by doing” approach has meant that farmers have adopted successful farming practices, including mulching as a key practice for soil moisture conservation. This is crucial in Nkhotakota where temperatures are high due to its low altitude along the lakeshore. The FFS’s 1.8-hectare piece of land has 53 000 plants that have already started bearing fruit. With an average selling price of 500 Malawian Kwacha (USD 0.68) per pineapple, Chitontho FFS members’ potential earnings stand at 35 million Malawian Kwacha (USD 47 619) per annum after the first year. They hope that harvests will increase from the current 53 000 to about 70 000 fruits in subsequent years. The next step, of course, is selling the fruit. Currently, Chitontho FFS members have pitched a sales stand along the main road passing through the Nkhotakota district – but their long-term plans go much further than the local community. “Our goal right now is to find reliable buyers such as juice-making companies that can buy the fruit directly from us, at a fair price and make payments on time, and we need to do this fast,” says Cosmas, the FFS’s marketing officer. The KULIMA project has engaged the Agribusiness Officer at the District Agriculture Office, Sani Kaombe, who is working on capacity building with the FFS members and supporting them as they identify potential markets. The goal is to transition the FFS into a cooperative and link Chitontho members with the original group of farmers growing pineapple in the district to increase their selling power. A local community in Malawi has come together to try a new venture: pineapple farming. ©FAO/T. Munthali The group is also exploring opportunities that will ensure more profits for their products, such as buying additional land to increase their production capacity. Currently, the Chitontho FFS has started to increase its production by farming on members’ individual farms. For this community, farming had always been a way of life – but they knew that traditional methods weren’t going to sustain them. Innovative thinking, a desire to learn together as a community and a little willingness to take risks has certainly paid off. This is what the Sustainable Development Goals are all about – boosting innovation in areas like agriculture and creating long-term, sustainable livelihoods for communities around the world.

Parliamentarians from around the world met on June 18 for the first in a series of virtual dialogues on parliamentary action for gender equality and resilient food systems in response to Covid-19. These dialogues, hosted by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) and Oxfam , will offer parliamentarians a platform to share their experiences on various topics across regions. In the first webinar of the series, parliamentarians from Africa, Europe, Latin America and the Caribbean had an opportunity to exchange lessons learned and share good practices on gender-sensitive approaches to food security and nutrition during the COVID-19 crisis and beyond. Welcoming the participants to the discussion, Marcela Villareal, Director of Partnerships at FAO, emphasized the importance of parliamentarians as key development actors. Given their legislative, budgetary and policy oversight responsibilities, parliamentarians play a central role in establishing an enabling political and legislative environment which can lead to the achievement of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), including SDG 2, Zero Hunger and SDG 5, Gender Equality. The COVID19 pandemic has clearly demonstrated how important it is to strengthen multilateral and multi-stakeholder cooperation and action to fully address the challenges we face. Jocelyn Brown Hall, FAO’s Deputy Regional Representative for Africa, echoed these sentiments, agreeing that regulations, laws and policies are the key to creating an enabling environment to empower women, end poverty and hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture. She referenced the meeting of African Ministers of Agriculture, jointly convened by the African Union Commission and FAO in April, where the ministers, mindful of Africa’s commitment to end hunger by 2025 , pledged to redouble their efforts and concentrate on actions which would ensure food security and nutrition for all citizens, both during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Tacko Ndiaye, Senior Gender Officer with FAO, laid the groundwork for the discussion with a sobering presentation on the current state of food security and nutrition in the world and its implications for gender equality. She highlighted broad policy recommendations that could mitigate the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on rural women and girls, stressing the need to ensure women’s participation in social protection interventions, agri-food value chains and formal and informal networks which contribute to the COVID-19 response.

      "article_text": "16 June 2020 – FAO North America and CARE organized the first Food Systems Dialogue focusing specifically on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment for Food Security and Nutrition. The interactive dialogue focused on the often-invisible role of women in food systems, and the urgent need for women’s empowerment to build back better from the COVID-19 pandemic. The virtual dialogue, moderated by Tonya Rawe, Director for Global Food and Nutrition Security at CARE, featured nine breakout sessions on topics ranging from women’s decision-making power, access to productive resources and services, gender-based violence, indigenous women, cash transfers and the role of institutional environments. Experts from CARE, FAO, IFAD, WFP, UNSCN, Feed the Truth, GAIN and the World Bank facilitated the sessions. Over 100 practitioners from civil society, UN agencies, private sector, and government institutions attended the dialogue and participated in the 40-minute breakout sessions. “Women play a key role in food systems and in times of crisis, yet they face the biggest nutrition challenges. Women must be at the center of the COVID-19 response planning and decision making,” urged David Nabarro, Director of 4SD and WHO Special Envoy on COVID-19. “Different power relationships between men and women matter in their own right, but also for reducing malnutrition and hunger. These different power relationships are most immediately manifest in unequal access to resources but frequently are powerfully reinforced by laws and norms. All three dimensions of power relationships need to be addressed throughout the food system so that decisions - from farm to fork - can work best to reduce malnutrition,” emphasized Lawrence Haddad, Director of the Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN). “CARE puts women and girls at the center of the 'She Feeds the World' framework to ensure that they have access to resources and decision making. Collecting the right data is important to inform advocacy,” explained Maureen Miruka, Director for Gender, Youth and Livelihoods at CARE USA. “In most households facing hunger, women often eat last and least. No wonder a disproportionate 60 percent of chronically hungry people on the planet are women or girls,” said Vimlendra Sharan, Director of FAO North America. The recommendations coming out of the dialogue aim to contribute to a set of globally accepted Voluntary Guidelines on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment in the context of Food Security and Nutrition at the Committee on World Food Security (CFS), and the 2021 UN Food Systems Summit. “The Committee for World Food Security is an inclusive platform for all stakeholders to work together for food security and nutrition for all, which has a new workstream on Voluntary Guidelines on Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment in the Context of Food Security and Nutrition. We are looking forward to the recommendations coming out of this dialogue,” stated Chris Hegadorn, Secretary of the CFS. Key messages from the dialogue noted: Gender equality and women’s empowerment play a central role in achieving food security and improved nutrition. We cannot achieve inclusive and sustainable food systems, eliminate hunger and malnutrition, or achieve sustainable development without the progressive realization of women’s rights and the right to food. Women must be at the center of the COVID19 response planning and decisions to build back better. Women and girls, including from indigenous communities and rural areas, should have equal opportunities to participate in local, national, and international processes and policy discussions, such as Food System Dialogues, the UN Food Systems Summit 2021 and other decision processes affecting food systems. “Gender is perhaps the greatest lever of social and economic change that exists in the world today. And until and unless we address gender inequalities, we will never actually transform our food systems, nor will we ever end hunger and malnutrition,” underscored Tom Pesek, Senior Liaison Officer at FAO North America in his closing remarks.

      "article_text": "©FAO/Vladimir Valishvili Georgia is primarily an agricultural country, and women are crucial participants and contributors to agricultural development. Nonetheless, the contribution of women to agricultural production remains invisible and under-recognized. These women also face difficulties in accessing crucial resources such as land, agricultural inputs, new technologies, and financing opportunities, as well as information, extension services, and training opportunities. With better agricultural knowledge rural women could enhance their farms’ production and raise standard of living for their children and families. To overcome this shortcoming, female farmers in Georgia have learned about agricultural production and good practices from FAO and the European Union (EU) under the umbrella of the European Neighborhood Programme for Agricultural and Rural Development ( ENPARD ). Tsiuri Beridze lives in Georgia’s mountainous Adjara region that is short of arable land and thus challenging enough even for FAO agronomists. She was among the first female farmers in her community volunteering to learn about the new agricultural practices and technologies. “Manual transplanting turns work into suffering, but from FAO and EU programme experts I’ve learnt that it can be done in a smarter and easier way,” Tsiuri said, who cultivates a 0.05 hectare plot. She vigorously enriched her substantial experience of tomato production and took full advantage of producing vegetable seedlings in trays, arranging ridges and mulch, as well as using transplanters for seedlings, a process which ultimately saved her a lot of hard, physical work. “Seeing my example, my neighbors also decided to buy transplanters for the next season. This is just one small development along with a lot of useful information and tips that professional agronomists provided for us,” she added. The support is multidimensional, and, building on FAO’s experience, it ranges from establishing demonstration plots and farmer field schools to helping make the best decisions for improving crop qualities and increasing incomes. Activities cover several municipalities all across the country (Akhalkalaki, Akhmeta, Dedoplistskaro, Keda Lagodekhi, Tetritskaro, Tsalka, and Tskaltubo), and haven’t even stopped due to the COVID-19 lockdown. Luda Manuilova (left) and Inga Beruashvili (right) working on their lands. Photo: ©FAO Climate-smart methods Luda Manuilova owns 50 hectares of agricultural land in Lagodekhi municipality. For two years, Luda has been closely working with FAO experts and experimenting with conservation agriculture practices, such as minimum tillage. As a result, the joint work and improved production methods are bearing fruit: she could harvest more maize with lower production costs, as minimum tillage requires less fuel consumption and land preparation time. Moreover, Luda started sharing her experience and acquired knowledge with fellow farmers in the community, as well as providing mechanization services and other agricultural supplies to them. “I am always happy to motivate other farmers in my community, especially women. I’m willing to show them how to adopt new practices and improve their yields,” Luda said. Female farmers living in internally displaced settlements in Georgia have also received help. Inga Beruashvili had to flee her home following the 2008 conflict, forcing her to start a new life and farming from scratch in the Koda settlement, located in the south of the country. In her demonstration plot, where vegetables are grown, Inga used climate-smart agriculture practices, including mulching, bed formation, and drip irrigation, with support from FAO and the EU. All these helped increase crop resilience to drought, floods, and other extreme weather events. She is keen to help others by sharing these good practices with her neighbours and engaging other internally displaced women in the settlement to take up agriculture. Tsiuri Beridze was among the first female farmers in her community volunteering to learn about the new agricultural practices and technologies. Photo: ©FAO/Meri Bekauri Training series for agricultural extension specialists Along with enhancing the knowledge of female farmers in Georgia’s remote districts, FAO and the EU also organized a series of gender training sessions for state agricultural extension specialists in February. So far, more than 100 people from seven different municipalities of Georgia have participated in the training programme, aimed at equipping them with necessary tools for mainstreaming gender into their work. Participants learned new information and theoretical concepts from FAO experts on gender and gender mainstreaming. Based on the knowledge obtained, the extensionists are expected to design and deliver better advice to the farmers in a gender-sensitive way. Enhancing livelihoods of rural population, particularly of women, is part of the FAO-EU support to the Ministry of Environmental Protection and Agriculture of Georgia in the implementation of the gender inclusive National Strategy for Agricultural Extension 2018–2020. The European Union supports rural development in Georgia through its ENPARD Programme. With the goal of reducing rural poverty, ENPARD has been funded with a total budget of 179.5 million euros since operations began in 2013.

We need to invest in statistics, and especially disaggregated data on gender.” Dr Clarke also referred to the importance of promoting and facilitating access to healthy diets for Caribbean populations. “Food security is vital, but so is nutrition,” she noted. All participants agreed that as governments develop longer-term economic stimulus packages to help societies recover from the pandemic, they should make sure to design these responses around the core principle of building a more inclusive and sustainable economy.

Working in a group ensures that the women can supply more crops, secure stable and good prices as well as share costs. ©Photo: ©FAO/Luis Tato 6 March 2020, Rome - The three United Nations' Rome-based agencies dedicated to food and agriculture called today for bolder action to achieve gender equality and empower women and girls in the agricultural sector and beyond. Securing sustainable global food systems is only possible if women everywhere are empowered and their rights recognized and respected, stressed FAO, IFAD and WFP at an event today marking International Women's Day (IWD) at FAO headquarters. This year's IWD - with the theme \" I am Generation Equality: Realizing Women's Right s\" - is an opportunity to review global progress on gender equality and women's empowerment in the 25 years since the Fourth World Conference on Women [1] , identify remaining gender gaps, and outline the way forward. \"FAO will continue to play its part, in partnership with others, in strengthening gender equality, realizing women's rights and accelerating their socio-economic empowerment. Only then will we reach our common goal: to eradicate hunger, ensure food security, eliminate all forms of malnutrition, and make this world a better place for us,\" said FAO Director-General QU Dongyu. \"Each year, International Women's Day is both a cause for celebration and a call for action,\" said Gilbert F. Houngbo, IFAD President. \"Collectively, we can work together to create a gender-equal world. Not simply because it's the right thing to do, but also because it makes sense. Increasing gender equality is critical to deliver strong economic growth. It can help cut down on extreme poverty and reduce chronic hunger. It can lead to longer-lasting peace. And it can benefit entire families and empower all those who face discrimination.\" \"We know Zero Hunger will not be achieved just by giving people food. This is why our programmes work to empower women so they can be financially self-sufficient and make their own decisions. By giving women and men an equal voice and an equal say on issues affecting their families and communities we can eradicate hunger and malnutrition,\" said WFP Assistant Executive Director, Manoj Juneja. Women, especially in rural areas, are instrumental in the fight against hunger and malnutrition and in making food systems more productive and sustainable. They grow food, reduce food losses, make diets more diverse and agricultural produce more marketable along the agri-food value chains. Yet, in many parts of the world women continue to face significant social and economic discrimination. They often lack access to productive resources, agricultural inputs, information, finance, services, markets, social protection as well as technological and entrepreneurial know-how. In addition, many rural women are the primary caretakers in their households, which means they face heavy workloads that undermine their productive capacity and overall well-being. When rural women are empowered, the results are palpable FAO, IFAD and WFP know from experience that when rural women have better access to resources, services, economic opportunities and decision making, the results are palpable: communities have more food, their nutrition status improves, rural incomes increase and food systems become more efficient and sustainable. For example, nearly 50,000 people (two thirds of them women) and, by extension, over 300,000 family members across seven countries (Ethiopia, Guatemala, Kyrgyzstan, Liberia, Nepal, Niger and Rwanda) increased their agricultural production and their families' nutrition status as well as their incomes thanks to a joint FAO, IFAD, WFP and UN Women programme that entailed capacity development, technical support and the promotion of gender-responsive approaches in rural institutions and gender-sensitive agricultural policies. Despite some progress, change has been slow for most of the world's women and girls The three Rome-based UN agencies also note that there are still gaps in our knowledge about the differences between men and women in terms of their roles and opportunities in agriculture, and how gender disparities play out in different ecological, cultural and political contexts. What is well known, however, is that rural women are disproportionately vulnerable to food insecurity as well as economic and environmental shocks. Furthermore, harmful social norms and stereotypes on what women can or should do persist in many parts of the world, but these are difficult to address through conventional interventions. Food taboos that are detrimental to women's health and nutrition are still prevalent in many countries. In some areas of Africa or Asia, for example, pregnant and nursing women are not allowed to eat certain nutritious foods, such as fish. Overall, despite some progress, change has been slow for most of the world's women and girls. Not one single country can claim to have achieved gender equality. Events marking this year's IWD present opportunities to mobilize global action to achieve gender equality and all women's and girls' human rights. The event hosted by FAO today brings together representatives of the UN agencies' member states, gender experts, representatives of civil society and others to discuss how we can close the existing gender gaps in agriculture and rural livelihoods. The event also showcases good practices in establishing national policies and programmes for promoting gender equality and rural women's empowerment. Gender equality in the food and agriculture sectors - facts and figures: ● The agriculture sector is underperforming in many developing countries, and one reason is that women do not have the same access as men to the inputs, resources, services and opportunities that they need to be more productive. ● Women comprise nearly 50 percent of employment in agriculture in low-income countries. ● Women represent less than 15 percent of all landowners, where data is available. ● Compared to male farmers, female farmers typically manage smaller plots of land and have less access to agricultural information, financial services, and other key resources. ● More than 820 million people do not have enough food to eat, and on every continent, women are more likely than men to be affected by moderate or severe food insecurity. ● Rural women face higher risks and greater burdens from climate change impacts. Note to editors : a video news release on a women-focused project supported by FAO is available on FAO's Media Vault . The project focuses on supporting women clam harvesters to earn more for their labour, whilst making their harvesting practices more sustainable. [1] The 2020 IWD theme is aligned with UN Women's new multigenerational campaign, Generation Equality, which marks the 25th anniversary of the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action, the most progressive roadmap for the empowerment of women and girls.

Since nearly the start of the year, Fatima has lived in a small tent made from her family’s clothing, propped up by sticks. She receives food assistance but it is usually cereal-based. The mother of two, as well as 3 000 other people in Gubio and New Stadium Camps close to the Borno State capital, benefited from a week’s supply of fresh foods including eggs, sweet potatoes, cabbage, carrots, tomatoes and other locally sourced produce. “This is the first time in three months that I will be able to eat fresh food like eggs and vegetables”, said Fatima. When asked what she was most excited to cook, her answer came quickly. “I will boil the potatoes and cabbage for myself and the babies this evening”, she said, unable to conceal a smile. FAO’s initiative was supported by the Government of Switzerland through the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation . Beneficiaries were registered electronically and received voucher cards that they later redeemed for fresh foods. Through these distributions, FAO provides a market for smallholders, especially for producers of fresh foods that typically face high perishability and unstable prices .

Moreover, developing simple techniques for local communities to grow food in their own small backyards allows them secure an adequate supply of nutritious food in the future. In the Syrian Arab Republic , where agriculture is the largest sector of the economy, schoolchildren learn about agricultural practices, various types of food, the importance of healthy diets and the nutritional value of food as part of their curriculum. However, many schools lack a space where they can gain hands-on experience growing fruit and vegetables. To change this, the Government of Japan supported the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to design and implement a project to establish gardens in public schools. The project also included in-class lectures and training sessions with a practical component to teach schoolchildren and teachers how to follow planting instructions and improve their understanding of nutrition . More than 3 000 students, their teachers and families in Homs and Rural Damascus governorates benefitted from this project–teachers’ developed their educational practices and schoolchildren gained technical and experiential knowledge on growing food in a 200 m2 space. “The future of food security in the Syrian Arab Republic will become brighter when children have a better understanding of nutrition-sensitive agriculture and healthy diets concepts. Through the establishment of school gardens under the “Education for All” programme, with the support of the Government of Japan, children will appreciate food more because they grew their own vegetables, maybe for the first time in their lives and we do hope they carry these positive practices forward into the future,” said Mike Robson, FAO Representative in the Syrian Arab Republic.

The EU and the three UN agencies share the view that achieving gender equality and women's empowerment are key for food security and nutrition. \"While many conventional approaches for closing the gender gaps in agriculture continue to be perfectly relevant, we have to think more creatively and be more daring in our actions,\" said FAO Deputy Director-General for Programmes Daniel Gustafson. \"By promoting gender-transformative change, we can pave the way for gender equality within rural households and communities, in rural organizations, among service-providers and other value chain actors, and ultimately in policy processes\".

Consecutive drought in the last three years – followed by a severe drought during the 2017/2018 wet season – hit almost two out of three provinces in Afghanistan , destabilizing the lives of vulnerable families and pressuring the adoption of negative coping strategies. The varied coping strategies include distress sale of productive assets (livestock and land), indebtedness and displacement from rural to urban areas, especially in the West region. The severe drought compounded the chronic food insecurity caused mainly by the years of conflict and recurrent natural disasters. According to the latest Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) analysis , an estimated 13.5 million people across the country are severely food insecure. The hardest hit area was the western region, where more than 300 000 people have fled to Badghis, Ghor and Herat provinces. In Herat, more than 1 million people are in dire need of food and water. This figure has been added upon an already number of drought-affected people , who are in immediate need of emergency assistance in Herat. Rezeshk, a poor village in Herat, was particularly affected by the drought . Families living in this village are highly dependent on farming and their livestock to make a living. The persisting drought in this village resulted in crop production losses, animal mortality and morbidity, distress sale of livestock and outbreak of human diseases due to lack of nutritious food. For 60-year-old Ziba, a Rezeshk-native living in a household of ten members, this is the reality. Agriculture is the main source of income for her and her family. But this year, their animal failed to produce enough milk and their crops failed due to water shortage. “The drought has ruined our lives. Our crop production has become low and we do not get enough nutritious food. We all have become sick,” she said. Learn more"

Adolescent girls are also participating of the activities conducted by the Care Groups and benefiting from the information and key messages shared in relation with food security and nutrition. “Through Mdachi care group, we teach nutrition to mothers of under-5 children and pregnant women,” says Getrude. “Not only that, we have various resources which we use to teach on hygiene and sanitation, breastfeeding, and we encourage growing of various nutritious vegetables to improve household diets. We also have a nursery growing seedlings to encourage members to grow fruits such as guavas, oranges and mangoes.” Learn more"

      "article_text": "Measuring the impact and results of a multiagency programme on rural women’s economic empowerment. ©FAO/Isaac Kasamani Since its launch in October 2012, the UN joint programme on “ Accelerating Progress towards the Economic Empowerment of Rural Women ” (JP RWEE) has empowered thousands of rural women, men and families in communities around the world. Working together through the programme’s integrated, layered approach, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the World Food Programme (WFP) and UN Women have reached 51 180 participants (40 227 women and 10 953 men), as well as over 465 000 household members (directly and indirectly) in Ethiopia, Guatemala, Kyrgyzstan, Liberia, Nepal, Niger and Rwanda. By encouraging policy environments that are conducive to women’s economic empowerment, and by helping to increase women’s incomes and enhance their decision-making power, the JP RWEE has succeeded in improving food and nutrition security not only for women, but also for their families and communities. In recognizing these and other achievements of the JP RWEE, a special side event was held during the Forty-fifth Session of the Committee on World Food Security (CFS). The event, entitled “Women's empowerment for food security and nutrition for all: evidence from joint UN work,” was co-organized by IFAD, FAO, WFP and UN Women, along with the governments of Sweden and Norway. It presented emerging lessons on the impact and results of the JP RWEE, including innovative methodologies to measure women’s empowerment in food security and nutrition. To open the session, Carin Jämtin, Director-General of the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency, noted the importance of gender equality and women’s economic empowerment in ensuring the right to adequate food, achieving food security, and improving nutrition for all. “This is even more important today, when evidence continues to signal a rise in world hunger, returning to levels from almost a decade ago,” she said. Ms Jämtin’s message was followed by a short video illustrating JP RWEE achievements in Nepal. Gerald Gunther, UN Women Representative in Kyrgyzstan, then delivered a keynote presentation on JP RWEE implementation in Kyrgyzstan, in which he discussed impact, outcomes and results from the programme’s first evaluation. In highlighting specific benefits of the JP RWEE, Mr Gunther noted the value of a collaborative, multiagency approach for achieving better results. He also cited the importance of the Gender Action Learning System (GALS) in facilitating real change in household gender relations and in enabling women to become economic actors and decision-makers. Plenary discussion The GALS approach was further discussed during the panelist presentations that followed, as Ndaya Beltchika, Lead Technical Specialist for Gender and Social Inclusion at IFAD, commented on key results and findings from the evaluation of household methodologies in JP RWEE countries. Ms Beltchika touched on the various advantages and benefits of GALS, not only in the context of project- and programme-level application, but also in terms of the transformative changes that are required to achieve the 2030 Agenda. She cited a growing body of evidence confirming that the GALS approach ensures both better and more sustainable results in gender equality and women’s empowerment, and noted that this was supported by the evaluation of the JP RWEE in Kyrgyzstan: the project cohort that used GALS had significantly greater and more sustainable results than the cohort that did not, particularly with respect to household well-being and livelihoods, joint financial planning and the distribution of assets. Susan Kaaria, Senior Gender Officer at FAO, presented an overview of results from a qualitative and quantitative assessment of JP RWEE beneficiaries in Ethiopia, using the Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI). As Ms Kaaria explained, the WEAI is an innovative, survey-based tool that measures women's empowerment in agricultural development, in particular across the domains of production, resources, income, leadership and time. By applying the WEAI to the needs of the JP RWEE in Ethiopia, the team developed a project-specific variation, known as the Project-Level WEAI or Pro-WEAI, which features additional indicators for individual empowerment, intrahousehold relationships, physical mobility, nutrition and health. A key strength of the Pro-WEAI is that it is both qualitative and quantitative: each aspect of the assessment informs, supports and supplements the other. Using the baseline findings of the Pro-WEAI survey in Ethiopia, Ms Kaaria highlighted many of the significant differences between men and women with respect to productive activities, control over income, time use and mobility. In follow-up to the presentations from UN Women, FAO and IFAD, attendees then heard from Ibrahim Bangana, Technical Advisor at the Ministry of Agriculture in the Niger, who offered a country-based perspective on the value of holistic, multisectoral approaches such as that of the JP RWEE. Mr Bangana confirmed that the JP RWEE had extremely positive results in the Niger, especially with regard to improved nutrition and food security. In particular, he noted the benefit of ensuring synergy among the agencies’ best practices and approaches, including those related to project coordination, implementation, and community engagement and knowledge-sharing (for example, through the use of Dimitra Clubs for men, women and youth). This maximizes the impact of the programme, as each component contributes to broader results. Closing remarks and way forward Per Mogstad, Senior Advisor for UN Policy at the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, then spoke on the importance of investing in joint initiatives for women’s empowerment. He discussed the ways in which the JP RWEE reflects Norway’s key priorities for international development, not only in terms of women's empowerment as part of a human rights-based approach, but also in terms of integrated approaches that build synergies between different UN agencies. To conclude the event, Amir Abdulla, Deputy Executive Director of WFP, offered closing remarks and reflections on the way forward. He cited the commitment of all present — UN agencies, government partners, donors, and the overall development community — to the JP RWEE, and underscored the importance of continued commitment from all sides. “The women that we serve though this programme — they clearly believe in it,” he said. “Let’s help more women reach their destiny.” Click here to watch a recording of the event."

The findings and recommendations of the AU-FAO study The Regional Outlook on Gender and Agrifood Systems were presented at the event. The Outlook is based on an extensive review of existing statistics, gender audits of 38 National Agricultural Investment Plans and in-depth country gender assessments carried out in 40 countries. The study's recommendations call for a \"gender data revolution\" in the agri-food sector to inform sound policies and programmes, and elevating the gender benchmarks in planning, monitoring and accountability. \"We need to put in place gender targeted programmes that address women's specific vulnerabilities but also their key role in household nutrition and resilience,\" Graziano da Silva said. \"Evidence shows that when women are empowered, farms are more productive, natural resources are better managed, nutrition is improved, and livelihoods are more secure,\" he added.

The event, hosted this year by IFAD, will include interactive sessions focussed on sharing knowledge and experiences about how innovative tools and technologies can contribute to the empowerment of women and girls. Many women, particularly young rural women, lack access to productive resources such as land, credit and technology. Women lag behind in terms of their access to ICTs, with only 41 per cent of women in low-and middle income countries owning mobile phones compared to 46 per cent for men. Nearly two-thirds of women living in the South Asia and East Asia and Pacific sub-regions do not own a mobile phone. Rural women regularly lack access to health care, education, decent work and social protection. As a consequence, they are more likely to be poor and they are vulnerable to economic and climatic shocks. ICTs can go a long way to boosting economic opportunities for rural women. Mobile and smartphones, for example, provide access to real-time information on prices in different markets and allow more informed choices about where and when to buy and sell. Studies indicate that when women earn money, they are more likely than men to spend it on food for their families and the education of their children. Learn more"

      "article_text": "“Sweden is happy to continue supporting a programme that has shown promising results and hopes that these new funds will convince other donors to join the partnership.” Recognizing the multiplying effects of investing in rural women, Sweden – through its development cooperation agency Sida – announced a US$5 million commitment to the Joint Programme on Accelerating Progress towards the Economic Empowerment of Rural Women (JP RWEE). JP RWEE is an initiative implemented in partnership between the Rome-based United Nations Agencies — the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD) and the World Food Programme (WFP) – along with UN Women. By joining forces, the four agencies, in collaboration with implementing partners, have generated significant results on the ground. Launched in 2012, the JP RWEE is implemented in seven countries – Ethiopia, Guatemala, Kyrgyzstan, Liberia, Nepal, Niger and Rwanda – and works to enhance the productive potential of rural women by improving their access to and control over resources, services and opportunities, and enables them to have a voice in their households and communities. In addition, the programme works to create a policy environment that enables support for the economic empowerment of rural women. “Sweden has shown leadership and commitment to the economic empowerment of women and to enhancing their capacity to eradicate hunger, poverty and discrimination,” said Azzurra Chiarini, JP RWEE Global Coordinator. “This is an important building block for sustainable development and for the achievement of Agenda 2030.” To date, the programme has benefitted over 41,000 women and 213,000 household members, who have received training on agricultural production, nutrition, income generation, leadership – just to mention a few - as well as agricultural tools, technologies, and credit to start or expand their activities. The additional contribution from Sweden will make it possible to reach more rural women and their families in the most vulnerable areas of the seven countries, and to extend the partnership for one year. “Evidence shows that the integrated approach applied by the JP RWEE is crucial for promoting women’s empowerment in development projects and has a greater impact on poverty reduction, as women tend to reinvest their income in education for their children or healthcare for their families,” said Mats Åberg, responsible for the cooperation at Sida. “Sweden is happy to continue supporting a programme that has shown promising results and hopes that these new funds will convince other donors to join the partnership.” Since programme launch, Sweden has been a key partner and the largest donor to the Joint Programme."

Health hazards from smoke inhalation are high, while the output f Kopalapillai Theivarmallar using the traditional fish-smoking method in her village in Sri Lanka. That is now changing with the introduction of new smoking ovens pioneered by FAO under a program funded by the European Union. In June this year, FAO with the European Union Support to District Development Programme (EU-SDDP) introduced the new smoking technology to Asia for the first time, starting with Sri Lanka where fish is a major source of livelihoods and nutrition. “The first thing I noticed was that the new technology helps me save time,” said Kopalapillai Theivarmallar who makes her living from fish-smoking to provide for her three daughters. “Before, I spent a total of 12 hours on two consecutive days drying and smoking the fish, and I used the old method of iron mesh. Now, 6 to 7 hours is enough to finish one smoking. It gives me plenty of time to take care of my children and do household chores,” she said. Since 2008 FAO has worked on developing the FTT-Thiaroye , an improved fish smoking and drying oven technology. The oven can be purpose built, or the smoke-capturing chimney, oil-catching trays and other elements can be added to an existing oven. It is designed to improve fuel-efficiency in fish-smoking by encapsulating heat and smoke. It also addresses health hazards suffered by small-scale fish dryers - the vast majority of whom are women.

A young farmer near Harare grows diversified crops to supply local schools, shops and markets. Speaking at a two-day workshop on “Fostering decent jobs for rural youth in Southern Africa,” held in Harare (24–25 October 2017), the FAO Subregional Coordinator for Southern Africa, David Phiri, said the issue of youth employment occupied a front burner. “The majority of youth do not want to work in the core agriculture sector because they consider agriculture as not attractive enough,” he noted. Peter Wobst, FAO Senior Programme Advisor, Strategic Programme on Rural Poverty Reduction, said the youth population in Africa, South of the Sahara was likely to double by 2055, but the youth continue to be many times more likely than adults to be unemployed. “Africa’s rural youth face particular barriers to accessing productive employment,\" he explained. “Young women and men tend to encounter challenges in accessing adequate knowledge, information and education, they have insufficient access to land, inputs, financial services, markets and ultimately, limited involvement in policy dialogue.” FAO has put in place several programmes aimed at dismantling barriers to active youth participation in agriculture in the Subregion. In Zambia, for example, a joint FAO and ILO project, Yapasa, launched in February 2016, has helped youths break into aquaculture and created decent jobs and entrepreneurship opportunities for young men and women. The project equips young farmers with requisite skills, facilitate loans for inputs including fingerlings and link the youth to market for their products. Learn more"

Eliminating gender-based violence (GBV) is crucial, not only because it violates human rights but also because it reinforces many contributing factors as an interview with FAO’s Deputy Director-General, Daniel Gustafson outlines on the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women . Why is this issue important for FAO? Daniel Gustafson: Globally, but in particular, in the agriculture sector and in rural areas, where FAO operates, gender-based violence (GBV) is pervasive. Statistics show that on average one in three women experience physical or sexual abuse in her lifetime . This is one of the most widespread human rights violations in the world, and it not only affects victims and survivors, but also their families and communities, as well as the peace and prosperity of nations at large. Humanitarian emergencies, food insecurity and poverty are increasing the prevalence of GBV, undermining our efforts to ensure household and national food security and nutrition. It is seriously impacting people’s physical health and emotional and mental well-being, as well as their ability to work and participate in community life. GBV affects primarily women and girls in their productive and reproductive years, compromising their capacity to be productive workers, earners and caregivers - re-enforcing the vicious cycle of poverty and jeopardizing agricultural productivity, food security and nutrition. GBV is the most extreme manifestation of gender inequality and a fundamental human rights violation. Protracted crises can create and exacerbate many forms of GBV, having a devastating impact on the agriculture sector and food security by reducing the capacity and productivity of survivors as a result of illness, injury, stigma and discrimination.

The agricultural sector, as well as rural non-farm activities in tourism, agro-industries, food storage and transportation have great potential to create more and better jobs, and to build stronger rural communities. “Investing in rural transformation and reaching a world free of hunger and malnutrition go hand in hand. Promoting better education, skills development and decent employment is vital for this transformation in Africa,” said FAO Director-General José Graziano da Silva, who is part of a group of world leaders at the high level forum, sharing experiences and best practice in creating and expanding employment and economic opportunities for Africa’s youth. FAO carries out 32 youth employment projects in 20 African countries. It supports countries and the Regional Economic Communities (RECs) to enhance their youth policies, strategies and plans, and social protection measures. It trains vulnerable rural youth not only in agricultural techniques but also provides them with business and life skills so that they can become more productive and active members of their communities. The Organization recently launched a Special Programme to promote youth employment through enabling agriculture and agri-business jobs in Africa. The programme is another example of FAO’s long-lasting collaboration with the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD) — an economic development program of the African Union — and of FAO’s efforts to strengthen partnerships.

It features data from a new source of additional evidence on the state of food security, known as the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) . Collected by FAO in 2014, 2015 and 2016, in almost 150 countries, the FIES data reveal that nearly one in ten people in the world (9.3 percent) suffered from severe food insecurity, corresponding to about 689 million people. The data also demonstrated pronounced differences in the prevalence of severe food insecurity across continents. Sex-disaggregated data An important feature of the FIES is that results can be analysed at the individual level, because surveys were administered to individual respondents. This makes it possible to compare food-insecurity levels among men and women, inter alia , with three-year averages showing that the prevalence of food insecurity was slightly higher among women—both at the global level as well as in every region of the world. A global reference scale The FIES is an experience-based metric of the severity of food insecurity; the analytical methodology was developed by FAO to obtain valid and reliable population estimates of food insecurity that are comparable across different countries and cultures. Respondents are asked about experiences associated with their ability (or lack thereof) to access food over the preceding 12 months—for example, if they had ever been worried about not being able to obtain enough food; if they had been forced to decrease the quality or quantity of the food they eat; if they had gone for entire days without eating; etc. The methodology provides the foundation for defining a global reference scale and for producing measures that can be meaningfully compared across countries for global monitoring. The gender gap in food insecurity was greatest in Africa, at 1.5 percentage points, with Latin America and Asia following at 0.7 and 0.6 percentage points respectively. The smallest difference between men and women was noted in North America and Europe at 0.1 percent, while at the global level, the data showed a difference of just over half a percentage point: 7.3 percent of the world’s men suffered from severe food insecurity, as opposed to 7.9 percent of the world’s women.

      "article_text": "Gender equality and women’s empowerment is central to FAO’s work in eradicating hunger and poverty, as it is to the entire 2030 Agenda. This was a key message among several discussed at the recent Special Event on “Leaving no one behind: Achieving gender © FAO / Carlo Perla The Special Event, held at FAO headquarters on 5 July 2017, during the 40th Session of the FAO Conference, brought together a panel of representatives from government, civil society and the private sector to share experiences and highlight examples of FAO’s work in gender equality and the empowerment of rural women and girls. Building on a series of events held at FAO within the last year (in December 2016, the High-level Event “Step It Up Together with Rural Women to End Hunger and Poverty” and in March 2017, the celebration of International Women’s Day), last week’s Special Event underscored the crucial role that rural women play in ending hunger and poverty as agents of change in their communities and families; the need for policies and programmes to accelerate rural women’s economic empowerment; and the importance of promoting transformative approaches to tackle the root causes of gender inequality in rural areas. In his opening remarks, FAO Director-General José Graziano da Silva reaffirmed the Organization’s commitment to support member countries in promoting gender equality and women’s empowerment, and unlocking the full potential of rural women to achieve global food and nutrition security. The Event featured a presentation by Kostas Stamoulis, Assistant-Director General of FAO’s Economic and Social Development Department, highlighting FAO programmes, projects, and initiatives that prioritize gender equality and women’s empowerment, including in the context of mitigating climate change and managing natural resources, building the resilience of rural livelihoods, reducing rural poverty, promoting equal opportunities from farm to market, and attaining food security and nutrition. “They are the ones...” Among the first to speak from the panel was Hugo Martinez, Minister of Foreign Affairs of El Salvador. The Minister discussed the importance of gender for food and nutrition security not only for El Salvador, but also for the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States (CELAC). He noted that El Salvador is currently incorporating a gender dimension into its national food security and nutrition policy and that, with technical support from FAO, UN Women and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), it is also defining a national policy for rural women, farmers and indigenous peoples. From a regional perspective, he cited the CELAC Plan for Food Security, Nutrition and Hunger Eradication 2025, for which a specific gender strategy was recently approved. The implementation of this gender strategy began this year with an initial pilot phase, through which it is being mainstreamed in five countries: Bolivia, El Salvador, Haiti, the Dominican Republic and Paraguay. This was followed by a recorded statement from Néziha Labidi, Minister of Women and Family Affairs of Tunisia, who gave a brief overview of strategic national initiatives to empower rural women and promote gender equality. These included a new multi-sectoral national strategy, approved by Tunisia’s Council of Ministers earlier this year, which aims to improve women’s financial and economic autonomy, for example through better access to credit and through the use of a website that will enable them to sell their products online. The Minister noted that rural women make up 33 percent of Tunisia’s population, and closed by underscoring their importance for generations to come. “They are the ones who will ensure our bright future,” she said. National strategy documents were also a key focus for Ty Sokhun, Secretary of State, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Cambodia, who highlighted his government’s commitment to gender equity and improving the status of women. In this context, he noted the value of FAO’s work in the country, citing for example a Technical Cooperation Programme (TCP) on “Enhancing Gender Equality in Agriculture and Rural Development,” as well as technical support to the Ministry for the recent national census of agriculture, which provided decision-makers, development planners and policy-makers with gender-disaggregated information. Next on the panel was Fatimata Dia Sow, Commissioner for Social Affairs and Gender of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS), who shared some examples of ECOWAS’s work for rural women in agricultural production and natural resource management. These included the distribution of multifunctional platforms and support to women in cross-border trade, and a range of programs for women entrepreneurs (focused on training, competitiveness, business incubation and ICTs). Among the most important initiatives for ECOWAS, however, is a project conducted jointly with FAO, on “Gender Responsive National and Regional Agricultural Investment Plans (NAIPs) for Meeting the Zero Hunger Challenge in the ECOWAS Region.” Key deliverables of this project include an ECOWAS Gender and Agriculture Action Plan (along with a roadmap for implementation), National Gender Assessments of agriculture and rural development in all ECOWAS states, an ECOWAS-FAO publication on gender and agrifood systems, capacity building on gender mainstreaming, and much more. Speaking next, Ali Recep Nazli, General Director of Foreign Relations and EU Coordination of Ministry of Food and Agriculture and Livestock of Turkey, also noted FAO’s role in ensuring gender-sensitive approaches to policy and programme development. Reflecting on the first phase of the FAO Turkey partnership programme (from 2009 to 2016), he noted that there were two projects focused especially on gender, and that further such work is foreseen for the new, second phase of the programme (2017–2020), for example, through a gender mainstreaming project for the region as a whole. Another perspective The final two speakers ensured that the panel finished not only with strong representation from civil society and the private sector, but with the individual experiences and perspectives of young, empowered women from the developing world. First to speak was Haowa Bello, a young woman entrepreneur from Lagos, Nigeria. Ms Bello is the CEO and founder of Madame Coquette, a company that designs and manufactures a line of luxury leather bags produced locally and sold globally. She is also one of the many beneficiaries of the Youth Employment in Agriculture Programme (YEAP) that FAO is implementing in Nigeria, together with the Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development. Ms Bello noted that the YEAP award, which she received in 2015, was a key catalyst. “YEAP has done tremendous work for my business. Financially it allowed my business to grow,” she said, adding that “personally, it made me responsible for my work and it made me aware that I make a difference in what I do.” “It made me feel that I have a responsibility not only to my community but to my country. The government recognized me and invested in me and I felt I had to give back somehow.” In addition to Madame Coquette, Ms Bello started Fula Farms, which now has a hundred dairy cows. She works with an informal cooperative of men and women from the area, but focuses especially on supporting the women. “I work predominantly with women to produce cheese and other dairy products. Fula Farms is committed to empowering women that otherwise have no source of income and no means of livelihood.” Ms Bello reflected on the need to better recognize women’s contributions in society. “Especially in Africa, in the region that I’m from, I feel women are not valued as much as they should be. Women play such a big role in our societies and I don’t feel that they’re recognized for all the work they do.” She offered her story as an example of what happens when women are empowered: “Being a woman, I know the importance of empowering women,” she said, and added in closing, that “if you empower one woman, you empower a generation.” The final panellist, Jessica Vega Ortega, spoke not only from the perspective of youth, but as a representative of indigenous peoples, and particularly of indigenous women. Ms Vega is a Mixteca native of the Oaxaca region in Mexico, and has worked from a very young age as an advocate in different fora at local, national and international levels, making visible the challenges of indigenous youth. Today, she acts as Focal Point for the Global Indigenous Youth Caucus, and is the Coordinator of the Yani Tundavii Dikuintií Collective of the Network of Young Indigenous Peoples of Latin America. Speaking of FAO’s work for indigenous women, Ms Vega highlighted the Leadership School for Indigenous Women , a special capacity building programme spearheaded by FAO and the International Indigenous Women’s Forum (IIWF, also known as the Foro Internacional de Mujeres Indígenas, or FIMI), which empowers indigenous women leaders and activists to advocate for human rights, food security and nutrition. “I have been lucky enough to be one of the young pupils in that,” she said. She also noted the importance of FAO support to indigenous youth. “We’re happy to see that FAO has taken our recommendations into account and is putting programmes in place for young indigenous people,” she said. “That’s had an impact, not just at the international level, but locally as well.” In particular, she cited the recent Indigenous Youth Caucus, which FAO hosted in Rome. “We were given a space,” she explained, which allowed the different groups of indigenous youth to prepare together for the upcoming annual session of the UN Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues. “This was the first time that we had the opportunity to prepare ourselves before the [Permanent] Forum, to coordinate our voices, not just the voices of women, but also young men, so we spoke as youth as a whole.” “In doing so we were able to really feed into the development of the movement, ensuring that our rights were respected and our voices heard.” Looking forward to October 2017 The Special Event ended with brief comments from Elizabeth Ssendiwala, Senior Technical Specialist at IFAD, and Kawinzi Muiu, Director of Gender for the World Food Programme (WFP), and finally from Kostas Stamoulis, who concluded the session with a look forward to October 2017, when FAO will be hosting a forum on “ Women’s empowerment in the context of food security and nutrition ”, which will take place during the 44th session of the Committee on World Food Security (CFS).

Graziano da Silva also highlighted the importance of partnerships in supporting rural women. As an example, he cited a joint effort of FAO, IFAD, WFP, and UN Women - the UN Agency specialized in gender. \"Together, we are supporting national governments to implement a global programme called \" Accelerating progress towards the economic empowerment of rural women \". This programme aims to improve rural women's livelihoods in seven countries, including Guatemala, Nepal and Ethiopia,\" he said. \"As a result, more women in these countries have been able to open bank accounts in their own names. More women are accessing credit. And more women are running their own individual businesses,\" the FAO chief added. Learn more"

The new school kitchen will provide meals to the 266 students at that location. This school is the first of 12 in which the new Programme will be implemented in the eastern department. “FAO, with the help of the Government of Brazil, is providing technical monitoring to Guatemala to implement the Sustainable Healthy Schools Programme through the Program of Brazil-FAO International Cooperation . Initially, two pilot projects were implemented in Huehuetenango and San Marcos to test the model in the education system tied to the Ministry of Education,” said Diego Recalde, FAO’s Representative in Guatemala, during the inauguration. The 12 schools in Chiquimula will join the initial ten schools where the pilot project was tested in 2015 and 2016.

Alejandro Ramos Esquivel, Chief Executive Officer of Notimex, expressed the agency’s interest in releasing news about the multilateral entity’s activities, as part of its social effort to support vulnerable minority groups, such as rural women in Mexico. These women represent a large percentage of the population, and they also assume responsibility as heads of families due to the high rate of male migration. Because of its potential scope in communication media and through social networks in Mexico and worldwide, Notimex is the perfect vehicle for reporting on successful production projects that receive technical support from FAO to drive its scope. Thus, more women, families and communities will know about the programs and, therefore, the development possibilities. For example, from agriculture for self-consumption, to being part of a production chain that drives its surroundings. Fernando Soto Baquero, the FAO Representative in Mexico, said that in order for the international entity to reduce gender inequality and to invest in opportunities for rural women, it is essential to eradicate nutritional deficiency, malnutrition, and to develop sustainable food systems. “The roles that rural women must play are countless, and include being farmers, unpaid family agricultural workers, day labourers, entrepreneurs in non-agricultural economic activities and domestic work, while also being mothers, wives, companions and daughters. Much of this work usually goes unrecognized and is not considered to be an economic contribution to the family or to society, although these women might work up to 14 hours a day,\" said Soto Baquero. This is why FAO congratulates Notimex, the leading news agency in Mexico and the top communication vehicle in the region, for joining the campaign to highlight the role of rural women, their current status and rights, and to empower them.

Their final aim is to improve agricultural production and guarantee food and nutritional security in their communities. The preparation of these advocacy plans is the result of the third phase of the Human Rights and Food and Nutrition Security Program promoted by the International Indigenous Women Forum, the National Coordinator of Indigenous Women of Panama and FAO. The first two phases consisted of seven months of virtual trainings plus a two week seminar. This program, led by FAO, FIMI and CONAMUIP, aims to provide indigenous women with advocacy tools that allow them to influence public policies, programs and budgets that impact their communities. Among the main challenges identified by the participants are food and nutritional security in their communities, access to technology to preserve and collect native seeds, access to credit and restoration of traditional productive systems. The integration of young people into communities through agricultural employment was also a main concern, as well as the lack of technical support to generate capacities of administration, organisation strengthening and tenure of their territories.

Reaffirming FAO's partnership with the African Union Commission in the implementation of the “African Union Campaign to confine the hand held hoe to the museum,” the two organizations launched an initiative on sustainable agriculture mechanization , to increase women's access to alternative energy sources and to reduce farm power dependence on human labour.

The study notes that participation of women is more pronounced in activities that involve time and physical effort, such as planting, weeding and harvesting. Conversely, they are less represented in those links of the productive chain associated with increased revenue generation and active participation in highly competitive markets.

In Malawi, as in other countries, child labour is a pervasive problem, especially in the agriculture sector. In 2015 FAO, with the financial aid from the Kingdom of the Netherlands, supported the efforts of the Government of Malawi to live up to its commitments to reduce child labour practices in agriculture through a nationwide mass media campaign. The campaign aimed at highlighting the role of child labour in the vicious cycle of poverty and stimulating debate on how to reduce and prevent it. A key aspect involved partnership with the National Smallholder Farmers’ Association of Malawi (NASFAM), an agricultural producer organization that has been sensitive towards child labour prevention over the years. NASFAM committed to increase efforts against child labour in agriculture by producing and broadcasting a dozen radio programmes on national media channels. Radio listeners, most of them from rural communities, were given the opportunity to submit their questions and views on how to reduce children’s involvement in heavy and hazardous tasks and how to get children into school. In parallel, the Department of Agricultural Extension Services within the Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Water Development (MoAIWD) produced a 15-minute video documentary on child labour in agriculture. Thanks to a communication team of extension workers travelling by van, the documentary was screened in a series of villages in remote areas of the country, where child labour is most rampant. Screening dates were announced in advance through local radio channels, and the tours targeted agricultural sectors such as tea, coffee, fisheries and cattle-herding, among others. As a result, more than 10 000 rural women, men and youth viewed the documentary and debated it afterwards. Learn more"

Yet females – who make up 43 percent of the agricultural labour force globally – are often viewed as unpaid family labour. Their contribution goes unrecognized, and they lack access to the rural services enjoyed by their male counterparts. In Azerbaijan, things are starting to change. Equal access to rural services for women, along with gender-sensitive agricultural extension services and personnel, are goals of an FAO project now active here. The initiative is financed by the Government of Turkey, and benefits from the technical expertise of FAO and Turkey. The three-way collaboration among Azerbaijan, Turkey and FAO falls under the FAO-Turkey Partnership Programme. This week, 35 experts working in rural advisory services are undergoing training in Baku. The workshop is the second of its kind, focused on evolving the experts’ understanding of gender relations and how they influence socio-economic conditions in rural areas. The emphasis is on developing tools and methods for designing demand-focused programmes that respond to the needs of both women and men farmers, while recognizing and addressing the specific needs of women. “It is vital to involve women in rural areas to lead the way,” said Tarana Bashirova, Assistant FAO Representative in Azerbaijan. “Training experts in rural development, and giving them the tools to analyze gender roles, will lead to improved gender relations and productivity on the farm. We have seen this with similar projects in Italy that had success with their advisory methods.” The project in Azerbaijan will focus on three provinces: Guba, Samukh and Salyan. Pilot training for women farmers will conclude with a workshop in June involving representatives of the Turkish and Azerbaijan ministries of agriculture and others. Together, they will discuss common challenges for gender-sensitive rural advisory services and identify good practices for overcoming those challenges.

We can see a democratic dialogue and we are learning through sharing our experiences and listening to the experiences of others,” said Elsie Mokudef, a Teduray from Maguindanao Province. “It’s time for us indigenous women to break our silence. It’s time for us to speak up. Then and now, we see in communities that only a few women are given the opportunity to participate in decision making and this is usually because they are insecure about speaking,” she added. Gender equality and empowering indigenous peoples are central to FAO’s mandate of achieving food security for all. In the Philippines, FAO has been working with the National Commission on Indigenous Peoples, Department of Agriculture, Philippine Coconut Authority, Department of Agrarian Reform, Department of Environment and Natural Resources and local government units to build the resilience of vulnerable indigenous communities and indigenous women to natural disasters through climate adaptive agroforestry methods that take into account their centuries-old farming systems.

It also expressed their determination to strengthen capacities of the ECOWAS Commission and Government institutions for expanding women’s opportunities in inclusive agricultural growth and transformation in the ECOWAS region. This involves gender responsive and inclusive agricultural policy and programme design, financing, implementation and monitoring. Improving Food Security and Nutrition In a statement delivered on behalf of Mr. Bukar Tijani, FAO Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative, Ms. Carla Mucavi, Director of FAO Liaison Office to the United Nations, said the Organization recognizes the centrality of gender equality and women’s empowerment to its mandate to achieve food security for all by raising levels of nutrition, improving agricultural productivity and natural resource management, and improving the lives of rural populations. “Our Policy on Gender Equality adopted in 2012 aims at advancing equality of voice, agency and access to resources and services between women and men in sustainable agricultural production and rural development”, she stated. “The gender initiative was very timely as it will provide an opportunity to put into practice gender responsive budgeting in the implementation of ECOWAP, the Common Agricultural Policy in the ECOWAS region. It will also strengthen gender equality outcomes in the implementation of the ECOWAS Zero Hunger Initiative and Regional Agricultural Investment Plan, while leading to the development of an ECOWAS Action Plan on Gender and Agriculture ”, Ms. Mucavi added. Accelerating economic empowerment Ms. Tacko Ndiaye, Senior Gender Officer at FAO Regional Office, noted that FAO had stepped up the implementation of its Policy on Gender Equality for a 50-50 Planet where women and men, including youth women and young men are equally empowered along agricultural value chains, using multi-fold approaches. These include fostering women’s equal access to land, finance, services and skills, as well as support gender-equitable poverty reduction strategies, and strengthening women’s leadership in rural institutions and producer organizations, as well as promoting their access to decent rural employment and social protection. “These lessons learnt provide a source of inspiration in implementing this technical cooperation project with the ECOWAS Commission, while building on other ongoing initiatives that FAO is currently implementing in ECOWAS member States”, she said. FAO is currently implementing projects towards women’s economic empowerment, such as the ‘Enable women to benefit more equally from agri-food value chains’ project covering eight African countries including Burkina Faso, Cote d’Ivoire and Ghana which focuses on fish processing and cassava value chain development. Joint UN Agencies programmes have focused on “Accelerating the Economic Empowerment of Rural Women” in Liberia and Niger and on “Accelerating Progress towards the Economic Empowerment of Rural Women Niger and Liberia.” Other views Mrs. Euphrasie Kouassi Yao, Minister for Women, the Family and Child Protection, Cote d'Ivoire: \"We would like to greatly welcome this project which opens good perspectives for sustainable agriculture, food security and zero hunger.\" Mrs. Bineta Diop, Special Envoy on Women, Peace and Security, African Union Commission: \"This collaboration between FAO and ECOWAS could contribute to poverty reduction and the achievement of zero hunger.\" See also UN Radio: Interview with Tacko Ndiaye ( et en français ) ECOWAS FAO Regional Office for Africa"

The speakers all agreed accelerating the empowerment of women everywhere is fundamental to achieving a zero hunger world and reaching the world's new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The dialogue, ‘ Planet 50:50: Step It Up for Gender Equality and Zero Hunger' , was jointly organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Development Law Organization (IDLO). This event commemorating International Women's Day also brought together partners from the private sector, youth forums, civil society and NGOs. Building broad-based partnerships is vital to implementing and maintaining the momentum required for achieving the global goals by the 2030 deadline - including gender equality. Welcoming guests at WFP headquarters, Executive Director Ertharin Cousin reminded everyone that \"stepping up\" on gender is not only a moral imperative but crucial to eradicating hunger. \"When given equal access to education and opportunities, women will exceed and their families and communities will thrive. With equitable access to the requisite resources, women will solve the beleaguering problems of hunger and malnutrition - changing our world for the better. Leaving this event, we must each ask ourselves what step must I take, both today and throughout the year, to ensure I will make a difference for girls by removing a barrier or opening a door?\" said Cousin. \"Women and girls are critical to rural development. Empowering them generates major gains. It allows them to become strong leaders. To participate equally, freely and take bold decisions. Our commitment to them today is a crucial key to our commitment to achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda,\" said Maria-Helena Semedo, FAO Deputy Director-General, Coordinator for Natural Resources. Five of the goals correspond more specifically to the mandates of the international agencies in Rome: SDG 1 - End poverty in all its forms everywhere; SDG 2 - End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture; SDG 5 - Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls; SDG 16 - Promote just, peaceful and inclusive societies and SDG 17 - Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development. \"We will not reach the sustainable development goals without more forceful and urgent efforts to achieve gender equality, particularly in rural areas,\" said Josefina Stubbs, Associate Vice-President, Strategy and Knowledge Department, IFAD. \"The commitment world leaders have made to leave no one behind and to build a world free of poverty and hunger is really a commitment to empowering women, regardless of their economic status, educational background or religion.\" \"Women's status in society and often before the law makes them more vulnerable to discrimination leading to negative impacts on themselves, their families and their communities,\" said Elena Incisa di Camerana, Regional Program Manager for Latin America and the Caribbean at IDLO. \"Ensuring everyone can enjoy access to justice and the benefits of the rule of law are critical to the success of all Goals in the 2030 Agenda, whether the focus is on curbing poverty, hunger, inequalities or equality for women and girls.\""

      "article_text": "Key stakeholders at AU meetings last month discussed practical actions to improve the livelihoods of African women, particularly in the context of agriculture and agro-processing initiatives. © FAO / Daniel Hayduk The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is set to invest in securing women’s rights to land and other productive resources, developing their capacity to boost food production and creating more wealth for family farmers, while preventing and minimizing food losses and waste. The objective being to enforce women’s right to land, food and decent employment. According to Mr. Bukar Tijani, FAO Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative for Africa, who attended the 28 th Ordinary Session of the Executive Council and the 26 th Ordinary Session of the Assembly of the African Union (26-31 January 2016, Addis-Ababa), key stakeholders discussed practical actions required to improve the livelihoods of African women through initiatives including in agriculture and agro-processing during this focus year. “With FAO's support to national governments, several countries have adopted national food and agricultural policies and action plans that fully integrate women's and men's needs. In this regard, FAO believes that investing in women along agricultural value chains is the right and smart thing to do for thriving rural communities and more gender equal societies in Africa”, said Mr. Bukar Tijani. “We are developing systemic capacity for expanding women’s opportunities in inclusive agricultural growth. For every dollar invested, the dividends are enormous in overcoming hunger, malnutrition and poverty and creating wealth for family farmers”, he added. Bridging the gender gap at FAO This 2016 African Union Year of Human Rights, with a focus on women’s human rights, provides a great opportunity to build on the 2014 Year of Agriculture and Food Security and the 2015 Year of Women’s Empowerment to make to equalize rights in access to safe, nutritious and affordable food, decent employment, finance and markets. According to Tacko Ndiaye, FAO Senior Gender, Equality and Rural Development Officer, FAO is aligned with the Malabo Declaration on Accelerated Agricultural Growth and Transformation for Shared Prosperity and Improved Livelihoods adopted in June 2014 which called for deliberate and targeted public support for women to participate and directly benefit from the growth and transformation opportunities to improve their lives and livelihoods. A particular focus of FAO is to support member Countries in the effective implementation of the “Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security” adopted by the Committee on Food Security in 2012. The Guidelines call upon States to ‘ensure that women and girls have equal tenure rights and access to land, fisheries and forests independent of their civil and marital status, and provide policy, legal and organizational frameworks that are non-discriminatory’. FAO and the NEPAD Planning and Coordination Agency (NPCA) jointly organized a Conference on women in agriculture in November 2015 in Durban, South Africa, to provide a dialogue forum for sharing experiences and best practices on gender-sensitive financial and business services, innovative opportunities to improve women’s entrepreneurial skills and development, the progressive integration of their businesses into the formal economy and building of strategic alliances for women entrepreneurs. Key issues addressed during the Conference, which will form the basis for strengthening partnerships between FAO and NPCA include financial inclusion for women in agribusiness; capacity development across value chains; knowledge sharing platforms and up-scaling or replication of models that can facilitate partnership between government, industry and academics for market penetration and competition. All these are key contributions to advancing women’s rights to food and decent employment. Concrete actions FAO is supporting women to participate more fully and profitably in value chain and agribusiness development by improving their access to financial services, business skills and technologies and innovations for agro-processing. At the same time, FAO is strengthening the capacities of rural institutions to provide gender responsive service delivery and enhancing resilience and social protection for women farmers. FAO is also implementing a Technical Cooperation Project on Gender Responsive National and Regional Agricultural Investment Plans for meeting the Zero Hunger Challenge in the ECOWAS Region with the ECOWAS Commission, and will implement similar initiatives with other regional economic communities. Gender assessments were carried out in 12 countries in the region to identify gender gaps in agricultural, rural development, food security and nutrition policies and programmes with a view to inform the next generation of National Agricultural Investment Plans and financing mechanisms. The aim is to ensure that women’s rights to food security, nutrition, resources and decent employment are enforced. Science Development and Research Two distinguished African Scientists - Prof. Umezuruike Linus Opara of Nigeria and Prof. Tebello Nyokong of South Africa were honoured with the prestigious Kwame Nkrumah Continental Scientific Awards, for their outstanding achievements in science, technology and innovation. Dr. Nkosazana Dlamini Zuma, Chairperson of the African Union Commission, and Martial De Paul Ikounga, Commissioner for Human Resources, Science and Technology, acknowledged that the programme is a joint effort between the Commission and its development partners towards a shared vision for promoting Africa’s development and integration through science, technology and innovation. “FAO will continue supporting efforts to harness science, technology and innovation with talented men and women in the continent. This is a domain that speaks to us. Renowned Prof. Opara, for example, has often teamed up with FAO to develop and improve programmes to reduce postharvest food losses”, pointed out Mr. Bukar Tijani.

Additionally, supporting the use of ICTs by women, for example internet and SMS, MMS messages reduces the gender digital gap and improves emerging farmers' access to information and markets. It was in this regard that 48 women entrepreneurs from Mpumalanga and KwaZulu Natal Provinces of South Africa underwent a digital training in the course of 2015. The 48 women farmers underwent the training were trained under the “She Will Connect” programme. Partners in the programme have joined hands to reduce the digital gender gap through providing digital literacy training, online peer networks and gender relevant content.

Yet even where participation rates are higher women’s comparative lack of access to credit and resources often result in lower productivity.” Another issue holding agribusinesses back from achieving their full potential is the ‘feminization of agriculture,’ a situation often occurring when men who traditionally worked in agriculture migrate, and the work they’ve left behind shifts to women who do not possess the same skills, access to credit, technologies or resources. We can leverage information and communication technologies to reduce the educational disadvantages faced by older rural women and we can encourage greater participation of rural women in cooperatives, farmer’s groups and collective action,” Kadiresan said.",
      "article_text": "ASEAN countries could boost productivity of their agribusinesses simply by improving opportunities for women to participate in the sector on an equal footing with men, a senior UN official said. “Women account for half of the world’s population and about a quarter of its agricultural labour force, yet many rural women remain marginalized and their productive potential in many countries of the Asia-Pacific region is woefully underutilized,” said Kundhavi Kadiresan, Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative of the UN’s Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). Kadiresan made the remarks during a Voices of Women side event at the 27th Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) leaders’ summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. “Women are the backbone of rural economies, especially in developing countries, yet they often have unequal access to credit or decision making processes, when compared to men in similar agricultural occupations,” she added. “There are also wide disparities in their agricultural participation rates, from a low of 16 percent in Afghanistan to 79 percent in Nepal. Yet even where participation rates are higher women’s comparative lack of access to credit and resources often result in lower productivity.” Another issue holding agribusinesses back from achieving their full potential is the ‘feminization of agriculture,’ a situation often occurring when men who traditionally worked in agriculture migrate, and the work they’ve left behind shifts to women who do not possess the same skills, access to credit, technologies or resources. Agro-industry, as a whole, is an important generator of employment and income, especially for women, in most ASEAN countries and the wider Asia-Pacific region. But steps must be taken to ensure that women in agriculture have the tools and support they need to become more productive, participate in the decision-making processes and enjoy an equal share of the rewards. “We can improve education and opportunities for girls in rural areas. We can leverage information and communication technologies to reduce the educational disadvantages faced by older rural women and we can encourage greater participation of rural women in cooperatives, farmer’s groups and collective action,” Kadiresan said. “These are things that, together, we can do.” FAO, in collaboration with member countries and other partners, are empowering women through work in ASEAN countries. In Myanmar, Lao PDR and Cambodia, employment for women has been generated in processing and packing facilities of organic agricultural products. Empowerment and leadership skills have been fostered through participation in cooperatives. Kadiresan pointed out that ASEAN’s inherent policy leadership and coordinating role make it well placed to create a sustainable environment in which women in rural areas could become more productive in agriculture. Through carefully implemented gender-responsive and pro-poor policy development, a win-win-win situation could emerge for women and their families, through enhancing livelihoods and nutritional well-being, improvements and increases in food production, and ultimately economic gains for ASEAN’s member countries. Kadiresan concluded by saying there is a role for all of us to play. “We can all contribute to making this possible by raising awareness and increasing knowledge, advocating, reaching out across and beyond sectors and strengthening collaborations.” See also: FAO Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific"

The publication provides comprehensive guid © FAO / Daniel Hayduk Based on recent research, evidence and experiences with CSA, the new module features good practices, innovative approaches, tools and technologies to help ensure that men and women benefit equally from CSA interventions and investments. It is aimed at a wide range of development practitioners, decision makers and other stakeholders in government, civil society and the private sector. Climate-Smart Agriculture and Gender The climate-smart approach to agriculture aims to sustainably increase agricultural productivity to support equitable increases in farm incomes, food security and development; adapt and build resilience of agricultural and food security systems to climate change at multiple levels; and reduce greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture (including crops, livestock and fisheries) wherever possible. Recognizing that climate change affects men and women differently, and responding to their specific needs and priorities is crucial to the effectiveness and sustainability of CSA interventions. Integrating gender in CSA ensures that both men and women can benefit equally and effectively, and that both adopt climate-smart practices to reduce vulnerability and strengthen resilience to climate change. The module features an overview of the CSA approach and the importance of gender in CSA, particularly with respect to major issues in investment, policy implications and institutional linkages. A series of Thematic Notes explore good practices, successes and lessons learned from effective gender-responsive CSA projects, programmes and investments across five thematic areas: innovative technologies, landscape approaches, monitoring and evaluation, household and community-driven development and institutions. Lastly, three Innovative Activity Profiles showcase specific aspects of recent projects and activities that may be considered for adaptation, replication and scaling up. Gender in Agriculture Sourcebook Developed by the World Bank, FAO and IFAD, the Gender in Agriculture Sourcebook aims to guide practitioners and technical staff in addressing gender issues and integrating gender-responsive actions in the design and implementation of agricultural projects, programmes and strategies. It provides practical advice, guidelines, principles, and descriptions and illustrations of approaches that have worked so far to achieve effective gender mainstreaming in the agricultural operations of development agencies. Modules are based on themes of cross-cutting importance for agriculture and rural development with strong gender dimensions, such as policy and governance, agricultural innovation and education, food security, product and input markets, rural finance, rural infrastructure, water, land, labor, natural resource management and crises and specific subsectors in agriculture (crops, livestock, forestry, and fisheries). The module was launched during the CFS side event on “Climate-smart agriculture and gender – evidence for equitable, food secure and sustainable agriculture,” organized by the World Bank, the Global Gender and Climate Alliance (GGCA), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and FAO. The side event, which brought together stakeholders from international financing institutions, civil society and the UN, featured a panel discussion on lessons learned and good practices in the context of gender in CSA. It also discussed practical and policy considerations for the future of gender-responsive CSA to enhance equality and food and nutrition security.

      "article_text": "There are nearly 600 million girls aged 10 to 19 in the world today. As the global community marks the International Day of the Girl Child this week, FAO recognizes the enormous potential of adolescent girls to transform rural communities and play their p © FAO / Giulio Napolitano The International Day of the Girl Child (Day of the Girl) is celebrated annually on October 11, and highlights the unique challenges and potential of adolescent girls. In recognition of the importance of investing in their empowerment and rights, both today and in the future, this year’s theme is “The Power of the Adolescent Girl: Vision for 2030.” Along with country events around the world, a global event at UNICEF House in New York on Monday 12 October will feature a moderated forum to foster thought, discussion, and action on issues related to the theme. The forum will be followed by an exhibition and interactive showcase highlighting examples of good practice. Rural youth, and girls in particular, are important agents for achieving food security and reducing poverty in the years to come. Yet youth in rural areas of the developing world face enormous challenges in making a living in agriculture. They often have limited access to knowledge, information and education, as well as to decent jobs, land, markets and finance. Those under 18 face additional barriers in accessing productive resources and services and in joining representative organizations due to their status as minors. These challenges are even greater for young women, and come at a stage in their lives that is often decisive in their ability to transition out of poverty. But lessons learned from FAO’s Junior Farmer Field and Life Schools (JFFLS), for example, illustrate what can happen when girls in rural areas have access to quality training in vocational, business and life skills. At the Bidii Junior Farmer Field and Life School in the in Kakuma Refugee camp in northern Kenya , for instance, girls aged between ten and eighteen learn agricultural, life and entrepreneurship skills in an experiential and participatory learning approach that is especially well-suited to vulnerable youth. As they attend to their plots of maturing tomatoes, cowpeas, okra, water melons and kales, they learn about crop spacing, pest management and other farming practices. The JFFLS is designed to empower vulnerable youth, and provide them with the livelihood options and gender-sensitive skills needed for long-term food security while reducing their vulnerability to destitution and risk coping strategies. “We have learned how to protect ourselves from HIV and AIDS and from sexual abuse and sexual exploitation that affects girls like us”, says Furaha Aziza, a jovial thirteen year-old from the Democratic Republic of Congo. Of course, training alone is not enough to overcome the barriers facing adolescent girls in many contexts. As young women transition out of schools, they need better access to productive resources such as land, services such as finance, organizations and markets. FAO supports its JFFLS graduates in joining cooperatives and producers’ organizations to ensure their voices are heard and they have better access to resources, services and markets. Better and more gender-responsive policy and legislation are also important, as are investments in employment creation and the extension of labour standards to rural areas, to ensure that young women have access to quality jobs with decent working conditions—including a living wage, health and safety at work, on-the-job training and access to social protection. If effectively supported during the adolescent years, girls have the potential to change the world – both as empowered girls of today and as tomorrow’s farmers, workers, mothers, entrepreneurs, mentors, household heads, and political leaders. As the global development community begins work on the Sustainable Development Goals for 2030, investing in realizing the power of adolescent girls will prove crucial. It upholds their rights today and promises a more equitable and prosperous future, one in which half of humanity is an equal partner in solving the problems of poverty, food insecurity, climate change, political conflict, economic growth, disease prevention, and global sustainability.

      "article_text": "Afghanistan’s Ministry of Agriculture, Irrigation and Livestock (MAIL) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations have this week launched a “National Strategy on Women in Agriculture Development”. The Strategy document was signed by H. E. Assadullah Zamir, Minister for MAIL and Tomio Shichiri, FAO Representative in Afghanistan. It was developed as part of the project, “Strengthening the Role of Women in Agriculture Development,” funded by the Government of Germany, and jointly implemented by MAIL’s Home Economy Department and FAO, which place women as central to all of their agricultural interventions. The Strategy was developed at the request of the Minister who acknowledged that “women are key, not only to ensuring increased agricultural production, but also for improving food and nutrition security.” The Strategy forms an integral part of the Minister’s ‘first 100 days’ work plan and is driven by the Home Economy Directorate of MAIL and FAO, based on their experiences in promoting women’s contributions in the agricultural sector, and complemented by primary data collected from different stakeholders. Women’s participation in agriculture critical to better nutrition Women account for nearly 43 percent of the Afghan agricultural labour force and so the Strategy will review the existing situation of women in the sector while planning to identify the key inequalities and constraints they face in the country’s system of food production. In particular, it will focus on accessing productive resources for increasing women’s productivity and for the achievement of food and nutrition security, both at the household and national levels. The Strategy is therefore designed to bridge the productivity differentials between male and female farmers and help the latter overcome the production constraints they face, leading to significantly increased agricultural growth and output. The Strategy also focuses on the crucial contribution of women in natural resource management as about 70 percent of women are directly or indirectly involved in a wide range of agricultural activities that are dependent on natural resources. Yet here too they are underrepresented in natural resource management committees and user groups. “It’s important to recognize and be aware of the vulnerability of women in agriculture and natural resource management, while understanding the importance of their increased contributions to these sectors,” said FAO Representative to Afghanistan, Tomio Shichiri. “By supporting women with skills and knowledge to access resources and markets they will be able to address food insecurity at household level, and therefore help strengthen food security nationwide.” The Strategy will recommend priority interventions that would provide an enabling environment for the empowerment of women in the sectors, while strengthening the institutional and individual capacity of MAIL to deliver efficient and effective services.

      "article_text": "Her Excellency the Honourable Baleka Mbete, Speaker of Parliament of the Republic of South Africa, delivered a special address this week at the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), on gender mainstreaming in the African region and beyond. In a presentation titled “Gender is my Agender,” jointly organized by the Embassy of South Africa, the Women Representatives’ Gender Network, the World Food Programme, the International Fund for Agriculture and FAO, the former Deputy President of South Africa shared experiences and insights on the changing role of women in private, public and political contexts, and the relevance of gender mainstreaming to food security, nutrition, social and economic development, government and policy. Speaker Mbete was introduced by Jomo K. Sundaram, Assistant Director-General and Coordinator for Economic and Social Development at FAO, who highlighted her role not only as Speaker of Parliament but also as Chairperson of the African National Congress (ANC), as well as her longtime involvement in issues of gender, in particular with the ANC Women’s League, where she served as Secretary-General from 1991 to 1993. The panel also included Her Excellency Nomatemba Tambo, Ambassador of South Africa to FAO; Anna Lartey, Director of FAO’s Nutrition Division; Brave Ndisale, Deputy Director of FAO’s Social Protection Division; and Juan Carlos García y Cebolla, FAO Right to Food Team Leader. The center of family and community Speaking extemporaneously, Speaker Mbete began by stressing the importance of a people-centered approach, noting the value of gender mainstreaming in this context: “What we have learned over the ages is that women tend to be more involved with the everyday lives of people,” she said. “I think therefore our understanding of mainstreaming comes precisely from this reality of what women are focused on, what women are interested in, what women are committed to.” She discussed an example from the early days of the anti-apartheid struggle in South Africa: “You know, the ANC is 103 years old. And although women were not always full members of the ANC (they were called auxiliary members), they were always involved in the struggle. It was not about them being in positions of leadership. They simply did the things that they saw [as needed] on the ground, in people’s lives — the things that were of concern to their communities.” Foremost among these concerns were, of course, those of agriculture and food security. In South Africa, as in the rest of the continent, she noted that the woman has always been “the center of the sustenance of the family and therefore of the community.” “The majority of people involved in agriculture—which is about the sustenance of people—are women. It’s the women who are there with the hoes, struggling [...] so that they can feed their families.” In another anecdote, Speaker Mbete discussed the 1955 adoption of South Africa’s Freedom Charter, noting that “a year before, the women had already come together and adopted a Women’s Charter,” which became “their submission when the Freedom Charter was finalized and adopted.” “That document is at the base of what today is regarded as one of the best constitutions in the world,” she continued, citing it as an example of “how women, their perspectives, their unique insights and their own reality in life informs their input into what in fact becomes a critical framework for the whole society. For me, mainstreaming gender starts there.” Empowerment Following Speaker Mbete’s remarks, each of the other panelists responded briefly to various aspects of her presentation, underscoring and reaffirming key points in the context of FAO’s work: Ms Lartey on maternal and early childhood nutrition and its long-term consequences; Ms Ndisale on women’s empowerment and equal access to land and other productive resources; and Mr García y Cebolla on the value of care as a critical human activity. Mr Sundaram noted the timeliness of the day’s discussion, both in the context of FAO’s work with the African Union (AU), which declared 2015 the Year of Women's Empowerment and Development towards Africa's Agenda 2063 , and in the context of the Post-2015 Development Agenda: “This week work has begun on approving the Sustainable Development Goals, where gender features very strongly, much more so than in the past,” he said. Concluding remarks were provided by Ambassador Tambo, who stressed the importance of creating expectations and opportunities. “When you provide women with financial resources and transport so that they can get their product to market,” she said, “you see how they start to see themselves differently.” “You see that they start to understand and believe in their own power, and what that translates into, is that they then develop expectations of their family members, particularly of their children. Because they no longer have a victim mentality, they have the mentality of winners.” See also FAO Webcast: Mainstreaming gender in the African Region"

      "article_text": "FAO’s Deputy Director of Social Protection, Brave Ndisale, spoke on behalf of the Organization at this year’s Conference on Tropical and Subtropical Agricultural and Natural Resource Management (Tropentag 2015) in Berlin, Germany. Photo by Flickr user \"Tropentag\" / CC BY Tropentag is an annual international conference on research in food security, natural resource management and rural development. This year's conference was held from 16-18 September at the Humboldt University of Berlin in Germany. Ms Ndisale delivered a keynote address to the plenary session on the first day of the high-level conference, emphasizing the crucial role that rural women can play in the fight to end hunger, particularly if engaged and empowered. In the context of this year’s conference theme, “Management of land use systems for enhanced food security”, she also underscored the importance of ensuring that women farmers have secure and equitable access to land, and discussed FAO’s work at the global, national and community level in this regard. Partners on board At the global level, Ms Ndisale highlighted the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests , endorsed by the Committee on Food Security in 2012. Gender equality is one of the ten core principles of the Guidelines, which make a specific call to governments to remove any and all legal inequalities that limit women’s access to land. “Why is this important for fostering women’s empowerment? Because not only do the Guidelines emphasize the significance of tenure rights and security for the vulnerable and marginalized, they also have a specific principle on gender.” Ms Ndisale reported that many partners are on board to implement the Voluntary Guidelines. “For example, Brazil has been one of the first to use Voluntary Guidelines as reference document on land,” she said, adding that “Sierra Leone is conducting a detailed review of legislation on the context of the Guidelines, and focusing also on gender-equitable laws and regulations.” “With the funding of the European Union and Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, FAO will support the implementation of the Land Governance Programme in Africa in line with the African Union agenda on land and in partnership with the UN ECA Land Policy Initiative.” Informed decisions At the national level Ms Ndisale noted that data, information and statistics are crucial for policy-makers, legislators, and human rights advocates to make informed decisions regarding secure and equitable access to land for both men and women. In this respect, she cited FAO’s Gender and Land Rights Database as a key resource for up-to-date country-level information on “the major factors, whether political, legal and cultural, that influence the realisation of women’s land rights throughout the world.” “At present, the database contains over 80 regularly updated country profiles. You can get information on gender-specific land-related statistics that has been analysed from national agricultural censuses and surveys, and you can get information on national policy and legal frameworks related to men and women’s land rights.” Concrete actions To illustrate FAO’s work at the community level, she shared two success stories from the Dimitra project, which sets up listener’s clubs in rural communities across Sub-Saharan Africa. Dimitra clubs are equipped with solar-powered radios and cellphones, so that when club members (men, women and youth) discuss shared development challenges and work together to find solutions, their conversations are aired on partnering radio stations. This stimulates discussions in other Dimitra clubs, which are broadcast in turn and keep the conversation going among all the area clubs, while also fostering concrete actions within and across communities. Ms Ndisale said that “thanks to such platforms, 600 women in the Banizoumbou province of Niger (where governance of tenure is largely customary), now have secure access to land. They have acquired a 99-year lease contract for a plot of 2.75 hectares.” “This gives an assurance of long term agricultural investment on the land for food security and nutrition both for family consumption and for sale in the markets of Niamey,” she added. “In the Democratic Republic of Congo, women of the Dimitra listener’s club joined forces to create a savings and loan cooperative, which enabled even the poorest households to buy agricultural inputs and thus improve their food security and nutrition.” Gender and social protection Finally, Ms Ndisale discussed the importance of integrating social protection and gender to reduce hunger, address inequalities between rural men and women and empower rural women. “FAO’s work on gender and social protection shows that social protection programmes, if well designed and implemented, offer greater potential for the economic and social empowerment of rural women and provide a viable solution to end hunger, especially if they are complemented with other livelihood interventions.” See also: Tropentag 2015 (Conference Website)"

Women are estimated to make up nearly half of workers in the seafood industry. © FAO / Giuseppe Bizzarri While women are estimated to make up nearly half of all people in the fisheries sector, their work often goes unrecognized and underpaid, their access to opportunities and resources remains limited and their representation in positions of leadership trails far behind other industries. These are among the key findings of a new review of women’s participation in the industry, published by FAO today. Capture fisheries, aquaculture and related post-capture activities support the livelihoods of over 120 million people, many of whom work in the traditional, small-scale sector. Fish are also an important source of nutrition across the world and provides more than 20 percent of animal protein in low-income food-deficit countries. Increasing gender equality in the fisheries sector is important for food security – both at a household level, where women contribute essential food and income to their families, and at the global level, where the seafood industry faces the challenge of sustainably increasing production to feed a growing world population. Production in the sector will need to rise by 20 to 30 million tonnes a year to meet these growing needs, according to FAO. The globalisation of markets, stagnating catches from the world’s oceans, and climate change are among the factors putting extra pressure on the livelihoods of women in the fisheries sector. In many cases, this adds to existing limits women entrepreneurs face due to established gender roles and a lack of access to resources like processing technology and storage facilities, according to the report, which traces women’s participation across the industry – from catch to professional conferences to corporate board rooms. Invisible women While men continue to dominate capture fisheries – particularly offshore and industrial fishing— women across all regions are often relegated to processing, local sale and support roles, including cleaning boats and bringing fish to market, the report says. These jobs are typically lower paid – in some cases unpaid – and less recognized for their contribution to the economy, employment and food security. Future growth in the fisheries industry is expected to come from fish farming, while FAO is supporting governments and the private sector to keep capture fisheries stable and sustainable. Yet, women who want to enter into fish production in some developing countries still face a lack of ownership rights that prevents them from owning a boat or land needed for fishing and fish farming. Limited access to loans, in addition, often bars women from starting or upgrading their own businesses and adding value to their products to better compete in an increasingly globalized and mechanised industry. Widespread gaps in sex-disaggregated data for the fisheries and aquaculture sector however are hindering efforts to address these gender issues, says FAO's study. A new network for women in the industry The problem of gender equality in the fisheries sector is not limited to small-scale fisheries in developing countries. It is also reflected in their relative absence in the board rooms, executive positions and fisheries conferences. Out of the world’s 100 top seafood companies, only one company is currently run by a woman as CEO, according to the report, compared with 8 percent of top positions held by women in the Fortune 100 USA companies. “Right now, the higher up you look in the industry, the fewer women you see,” added Audun Lem, Deputy-Director of FAO’s Fisheries and Aquaculture Policy and Economics Division. This, in turn, is keeping the industry back from rising to the food security challenge that lies ahead, he says. “The industry will not rise to the challenge of scaling up production sustainably if it can’t attract the best people. And it can’t afford to exclude 50 percent of people,” added Lem. To bring more women into higher management and research positions, FAO is working with corporations, seafood associations and universities to create a new network for women in the seafood industry. The network will aim to give visibility to women in leadership positions and attract more female professionals to the sector. The new network will be the first mechanism of its kind to target women’s roles in research and leadership positions in the industry and will augment other FAO initiatives that support women in small-scale fisheries at the community level."

      "article_text": "With the help of a new training guide developed by FAO and the International Labour Organization (ILO), extension workers in Africa and elsewhere are engaging with rural communities to reduce children's exposure to toxic pesticides used in farming. Children may be exposed to pesticides while on their mother’s back or in the womb. © FAO / Giulio Napolitano Nearly 100 million boys and girls between 5 and 17 years old are engaged in child labour in agriculture, according to ILO statistics. Many are directly exposed to toxic chemicals while working on the farm. But children are also exposed when they help with family chores or play, and through the food they eat and the water they drink. Children are far more sensitive to pesticides than adults. Exposure can result in acute poisoning and sickness immediately after contact. But often, it also has longer-term, chronic impacts on their health and development. Limiting pesticide use and promotion of non-toxic alternatives are important for reducing exposure, but education is equally crucial. Protect children from pesticides! – FAO and ILO's new visual guide, provides an easy, accessible training tool. It helps agricultural extension workers, rural educators, labour inspectors, and producer organizations in teaching farmers and their families how to identify and minimize risks at home and on the farm. They also learn how to recognize and respond to signs of toxic exposure. The user-friendly guide has three main modules: how children are exposed to pesticides, what the health risks are and why children are particularly vulnerable, and what can be done to reduce those risks. Growing interest \"The tool was initially developed in Mali, where it is now widely used by extension workers, farmer field schools, labour inspectors, and producer organizations\", said Rob Vos, Director of FAO's Social Protection Division. \"Its use is also expanding in Niger and other African countries. We are seeing growing interest from other regions. The guide is not only raising awareness that something must be done, but also showing what needs to be done.\" Not all situations are the same. The guide is not only available in several languages (currently in English, French, Portuguese and Spanish, and a Russian version will be available soon), but also adapted to different regional contexts, including Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean and Asia Pacific. The graphics and illustrations are adapted accordingly as well. Support from the Rotterdam Convention The effort to adapt the visual guide and promote its wider use is being supported by the Rotterdam Convention , a multilateral treaty to promote shared responsibility in relation to imports of hazardous chemicals. FAO and the United Nations Environment Programme jointly serve as the Secretariat for the convention. \"This is a good example of how the normative work of a convention can contribute to reaching out to the most vulnerable groups and make a difference to their lives\" according to Christine Fuell, FAO's Coordinator for the Rotterdam Convention. \"The colourful illustrations are built on local knowledge and refer to very concrete and real situations, such that they also appeal to children, raising their own awareness of the risks posed by pesticides.\" Why children are at greater risk Children are particularly vulnerable to pesticide exposure for various biological and behavioural reasons. They breathe in more air than adults and so take in more dust, toxic vapours, and droplets of spray. Relative to their body weight, children need to eat and drink more than adults, and if food is contaminated, they absorb more toxins. The surface area of a child's skin per unit of body mass is greater than that of an adult, and their skins are more delicate. All these factors can lead to greater absorption of chemicals, and children's organs are less able to detoxify pesticides because they are not yet fully developed, according to the guide. Young children often play on the ground, put things in their mouths and are attracted to colourful containers, all common behaviours that increase risk."

      "article_text": "Over ten years ago, in the village of Mvugo in Burundi, an FAO project set out to improve fish-processing methods with a simple innovation – a system of raised racks for drying fish. Today, the project's impact can be seen across Africa. And this weekend, © FAO On the shores of Lake Tanganyika in Burundi, a fish trader named Jeanne Nzisabira stands proudly by her rack of drying fish as she looks directly at the video camera: “I have learned the fish drying technique from fish operators' associations,\" she says. \"I realized that drying fish on racks is more hygienic. I was amazed and decided to sell only raised rack-dried fish.” Jeanne appears in an FAO video about the project \"Support to post-harvest fisheries technology,\" implemented by FAO and the Burundi Government in 2004. This weekend the video – and the story it tells – will be featured at Pêcheurs du Monde (Fishermen of the World) , an international film festival held annually in Lorient, France, that showcases new or recent films about fishermen and women, the fishing industry and the sea. The story The video, which will be shown on the last day of the festival, shows how the new method of drying fish using raised racks has enabled women across West Africa to increase income for themselves and their families. The method has been credited with empowering communities as well as improving food security and nutrition. In the past, the women, who comprise the majority of fish processors, had always dried the catches of small sardine-like silver lake fish (called ndagala ) on the ground, where they were easily contaminated, trampled, or eaten by animals. During the rainy season, many fish would be washed away or would start to rot. Working with Burundi’s Fisheries and Aquaculture Department, FAO started small, constructing just 48 simple wire-mesh racks suspended a metre above the ground. The project distributed leaflets and offered training on how to build the racks, and driers quickly saw the benefits: not only did the racks keep the fish safe from animals, they reduced drying time from three days to just eight hours, meaning they could dry multiple batches of fish in the same day. In addition, the racks could be covered when it rained, preventing runoff and spoilage. Word spread fast among fishing communities, and the use of racks exploded along the shores of the lake. Since the end of the project, the area dedicated to fish drying near the village of Mvugo has increased from one acre to five acres, and the number of driers at official fishing sites along the shores of Lake Tanganyika has increased from 500 to over 2 000. According to FAO Fishery Industry Officer Yvette Diei-Ouadi, the snowball effect has gone even further: “Even fishing communities in neighbouring countries have taken up the rack-drying technique,” she said. Women leading the process Ms Diei-Ouadi, who will be attending the Festival on FAO's behalf, noted the importance of women to the success of the project. “Women were at the center of the process,” she said. “Throughout the implementation they were the ones leading the process of learning and even transferring it to other processors.” Thanks to the raised racks, the quantity of fish lost or wasted due to inadequate drying practices has more than halved. And the longer shelf-life of the rack-dried ndagala allows for it to be transported not only to inland but also to transborder and regional markets, contributing to the nutrition of communities who live far from sources of fresh fish. Lastly, as the quality of the dried fish has improved, prices have more than doubled, from 4 000 Burundian francs (US$2.5/kg) in 2004 to 9 000 (US$6/kg) in 2013. To women like Jeanne Nzisabira, such differences count for a lot. Pelousi Ndayisaba, another woman fish dryer who is featured in the video, puts it plainly: “I am able to look after my child because of the business I do trading fish. It is the only activity that provides me with a living.” The Festival Since its inception, the Pêcheurs du Monde International Film Festival has showcased over a hundred films dedicated to fishing and fishers from all over the world. Along with awards, the Festival features debates and discussions between film directors, scientists, members of the fishing world and the public. Festival members this year chose to honor the memory of Chandrika Sharma, a tireless campaigner for the rights of small-scale fishers who was instrumental to the adoption of FAO’s Voluntary Guidelines on Sustainable Small-Scale Fisheries , by naming a prize in her honor. The Prix Chandrika Sharma will be awarded to a film depicting the struggle to recognize gender rights in small-scale fisheries.
