      "article_text": "Syria – May 2025 In the village of Deir Khabiyeh, located in Syria’s Rural Damascus governorate, Fatima Mohammed, 34 years with quite a heavy burden. Her husband has been missing since the early years of the crisis, and with no closure and little hope for his return, Fatima has stepped into the role of sole provider for her 10-year-old son. The weight of trauma, uncertainty, and poverty is real, but Fatima has refused to give up. Looking for a way to improve her livelihood, Fatima joined a Farmer Field School (FFS) established by FAO through the Building Local Resilience in Syria (BLRS) project, funded by UK Aid. The FFS focused on garlic cultivation, a valuable crop in her region. For Fatima, this was more than a technical course and it was a turning point. From there, she became involved in a network of FAO supported activities that further strengthened her capabilities and confidence. participated in the Economic and Social Empowerment (EA$E) framework for women’s groups. She also joined the Dimitra Clubs (DC) which are safe, community-led spaces where women discuss shared challenges and develop solutions together. Fatima eventually became the DC focal point in her village, playing a leadership role in a FAO innovation pilot under the Prevention of Violence Against Women and Girls (VAWG) Innovation Pilots integrated within the “Building Local Resilience in Syria (BLRS) funded by the UK AID. BLRS project seeks to improve medium-long-term food security and resilience for targeted communities in Syria. Fatima was also selected to benefit from a new agro-processing unit established by FAO in her community, opening the door to more stable income-generating opportunities. Each of these steps has helped her build both financial resilience and emotional strength. “As a mother and head of household, the road has been painful and uncertain,” Fatima said. “But through the support and solidarity of these women-led initiatives, I’ve found strength I didn’t know I had. I now believe in my ability to provide and to lead.” Toni Ettel FAO Representative (OiC) FAO Syria elaborates, “Under the UK-Aid funded BLRS project, FAO is combining social and economic empowerment interventions targeting both women and men to ensure that gains in building community resilience are lasting and do no harm”. Fatima's journey is quiet transformation, from isolated hardship to collective action, she has not only built a better future for her son but also become a voice for other women in her village. This is witnessing the important role Women are playing to ensure better life for their families."

      "article_text": "Ungheni, Moldova - Farm worker in tomatoes green house. ©FAO/Dorin Goian Gender equality and agrifood systems are intertwined, we cannot achieve one without the other. Women need agrifood systems, and agrifood systems need women. Women are agents of change in the agrifood sector. The FAO Report on the Status of Women in Agrifood Systems shows that over 66% of women in sub-Saharan Africa and 71% in Southern Asia are engaged in agrifood systems [1]. And yet despite this engagement, gender inequalities persist in the sector, from lack of rights to the land that women cultivate, to inequalities in access to resources and technologies [2]. And gaps in food insecurity between men and women persist which means that those that produce our food also the most food insecure. In 2023, 26.7% of adult women were moderately or severely food insecure [3]. And while even in times of peace women are more food insecure, during crises it is women who eat least and last. Gender inequality in agrifood systems is a wicked problem. And wicked problems do not have silver bullet solutions and require multiple innovations. It is important that FAO recognizes gender equality as a guiding principle in their Science and Innovation Strategy. The Strategy recognizes that achieving gender equality and equity between women and men in agrifood systems is critical for the elimination of hunger and poverty and commits to ensure that its interventions respond to the needs of women as well as men, including by promoting women’s inclusion and providing equal decision-making power to shape agrifood systems transformation. I believe there are four key areas where science and innovation can contribute to the triple win of gender equality, food and nutrition security and the empowerment of women. The first is in developing innovations that that are inclusive of, and work for, women. Very often, technologies, policies and practices are developed without the involvement of women and do not always reflect their needs and priorities. In many contexts, when people speak of farmers, they do not include women in this definition despite the important roles that women play in production and beyond production. And this has implications for how resources are distributed within the sector as well as how women’s labor is accounted for. And even when technologies and other resources are available, they are often not accessible or affordable to women. These gender inequalities in access and rights to resources are well documented [4]. Women also have unequal rights to productive resources including land. In 2024, women accounted for less than 40% of owners or rights bearers of agricultural land in 32 out of 40 countries with data [5]. Ensuring equal access to, ownership of and control over the resources and technologies that enable women to thrive in agrifood systems is critical. Rights to resources must however go beyond rights to physical resources to include rights to decent pay and living wages, rights to equal pay for work of equal value, rights to dignity within the agrifood system and the right to work in environments free of sexual harassment. For example, women in the agrifood systems sector are paid 82 cents for every dollar paid to men in the sector [6]. Data and innovations around pay transparency including in the informal sector – such as most of the agriculture sector – are needed. Second is innovations to strengthen the agency, leadership and representation of women across agrifood systems. Women and girls are taking action to address food security, climate, and environment action everywhere, but their participation and leadership is under-supported, under-resourced, under-valued and under-recognized. In 2021 at the UN Food Systems Summit, IFPRI, UN Women and Global Health 50/50 launched the Global Food 5050 Index. The 2023/24 report showed that 71% of CEOs and board chairs in food systems organizations are men and the situation had not changed from 2021[7]. This needs to change. It is not enough for women to just engage in production and processing of food, they need to be leaders in food systems governance and in the policy making process. Collective action approaches that catalyze women’s solidarity and leadership are also needed, and research can play a role in understanding, scaling and evaluating approaches that support women’s individual and collective agency. Tools such as the Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index [8] can be critical tools for understanding and identifying entry points for strengthening women’s agency. Third is addressing harmful and discriminatory social norms and addressing other structural barriers to gender equality. Social and cultural norms shape and reinforce the ways in which women and men can participate in, access, and benefit from opportunities and resources and this important consequences across all aspects of advancing women’s empowerment and gender equality in food systems. For example, norms can hinder women’s ability to access or adopt new agricultural practices, to own certain assets or resources such as land, or to participate in certain activities including agricultural markets or to access important services such as credit. These norms while contextually and culturally specific are strongly linked to women’s empowerment. Innovative gender transformative approaches that shift these norms and develop new understandings and meanings of masculinity have been tested and need to scale. Programs such as the Joint Programme on Rural Women’s Economic Empowerment implemented by FAO, IFAD, WFP and UN Women are important spaces for implementing these approaches at scale and measuring their impacts on gender equality and women’s empowerment. Fourth is ensuring that there is focus on the multiple needs and priorities of women in the agrifood sector by understanding and implementing policy, institutional and technological innovations that lead to systems change. These include innovations in social protection systems that reach the more than 700 million women who are in the informal sector including in agriculture [9], addressing women’s unpaid care and domestic work through the recognition, reduction and redistribution of care work including investments on infrastructure and labor-saving technologies, and addressing women’s experiences of sexual and gender-based violence including in the world of work. We need to connect the dots between policies to address these issues if we are to ensure gender equality and the rights of women and girls working in the agrifood sector. Science and innovation offer indispensable tools and approaches to do so, but only if the rights of women and girls are placed at the center. [1] FAO. 2023. The status of women in agrifood systems .

Held on 19 March at the Liaison Office of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in New York and streamed online, the event gathered over 300 youth leaders, policymakers and experts to discuss how education and training can empower young women in agrifood systems. Angelica Jácome, Director of the FAO Liaison Office in New York, opened the session by stressing the importance of integrating youth voices into policy discussions. “We must see youth as more than future leaders—they are already driving change with scalable solutions,” she stated. Ambassador Gianluca Greco, Deputy Permanent Representative of Italy to the United Nations, underscored the need to break down barriers preventing young women from accessing learning and training opportunities, particularly in agripreneurship. Lorenzo Gentile, Operations Specialist at the WFF Youth Initiative, introduced the discussion, which is part of a year-long consultative process. Furthermore, Martina Borrello, FAO Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment Specialist, moderated the panel, featuring youth representatives from global networks. Renata Koch, representing the Major Group for Children and Youth (MGCY), highlighted the intersection of gender, climate justice and agrifood systems, stressing the need for intersectional policies and youth-led advocacy for inclusive climate adaptation. Anoushka Sinha from the UNESCO SDG4 Youth and Students’ Network emphasized the importance of localized, accessible sustainability education, particularly in rural areas, as well as women-led mentorship and cooperative financial models to transform education into economic opportunities. Sara Kate Smith, from the WFF Youth Policy Board , spoke about the role of targeted training programmes and policy support in attracting young women to agrifood careers. She advocated for integrating agriculture into school curricula and implementing policies on land access and financial incentives to ensure long-term youth engagement.

      "article_text": "Interview with Nabil Gangi, FAO Deputy Regional Representative for Europe and Central Asia ©FAO/Javid Gurbanov Empowering rural women is central to fulfilling the mission of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) to eradicate hunger and ensure food security globally. Women play critical roles in agrifood systems as farmers, entrepreneurs, and community leaders. However, their contributions are often limited by systemic inequalities that impact their working conditions and economic opportunities. Women often have limited access to productive resources and opportunities as compared to men, which hinders their socioeconomic development and hampers agrifood systems’ productivity. Tackling these inequalities is essential for unlocking the full potential of both rural women and agrifood systems. This year’s International Women's Day theme, ‘For ALL women and girls: Rights. Equality. Empowerment,’ calls for actions that ensure equal rights and opportunities, particularly empowering young women and girls as agents of change. On this day, Nabil Gangi, FAO Deputy Regional Representative for Europe and Central Asia highlights the importance of tackling these challenges and takes us through several FAO initiatives in the region dedicated to building agrifood systems that are efficient, sustainable, resilient, and particularly inclusive, ensuring that no one is left behind. What are the main barriers that rural women face in accessing resources, employment, and equitable opportunities in agriculture across the Europe and Central Asia region? First, let me congratulate all women in our region and beyond on International Women’s Day. It’s a day to remind ourselves that women have been and will continue to be a pillar for our region’s development and prosperity. Rural women are no different, and dare I say a key player in FAO’s efforts for rural development and food security; they play a crucial role in sustaining our agrifood systems. Yet, they face profound inequalities that affect their economic opportunities. Across Europe and Central Asia, a lack of decent employment opportunities in rural areas has been a major obstacle for women, making it difficult for communities to leverage their full potential in agriculture. Their limited access to essential resources like land, credit, and farming supplies, are only some of the delimiting hurdles for their and their rural communities’ development. Moreover, some discriminatory traditional social practices of single-handedly managing household responsibilities add to the burden on women who find themselves also working in fields, cultivating crops, harvesting, and tending to livestock under such challenging conditions. It is no surprise that we find rural women spending twice as much time on household chores as men - and urban women - while facing long hours in low-paid work on seasonal jobs in the informal sector, increasing their economic vulnerabilities. Political tensions, civil unrest and “frozen” conflicts with periodic escalations have been particularly hard on our rural populations; disrupting their lives and often leaving women as sole providers for the livelihood of their families. All this has contributed to migration from rural areas, setting back their economic development and their traditional role as the food producers for their societies. I guess looking all this in the eye, leads us without hesitation to conclude that the key to reversing this economic time-bomb is to actively and seriously address the inequalities between men and women in rural areas, not only with robust policy interventions but also through active community engagement to dismantle the structural impediments that hinder women's full participation in agrifood systems. By doing so, food security can be improved and national economies reinvigorated. How does FAO integrate gender-related research into its agrifood system strategies and policies? Our key focus is to ensure that gender equality is not just a token phrase but a principal component in all our projects and initiatives. As such, FAO adopts a two-pronged approach; one through advocating for changes in policies and legal frameworks that provide the space for rural women to exercise their full potential through equal access to inputs; and the second is to promote such equality in all our projects and operational interventions through evidence based and key studies. The Status of Women in Agrifood Systems report which draws extensively on findings from the FAO-conducted ‘country gender assessments’ (CGA) has been key not only in shaping the design of FAO’s projects but also in influencing the formulation of national policies that directly benefit rural women. A recent example is from Georgia where FAO’s CGA uncovered significant discrepancies in land ownership between men and women. This insight has sparked wide consultations at all levels leading to robust initiatives for legal and financial reforms addressing equitable land ownership and enhancing support for agricultural value chains. Similarly, the Gender-responsive value chain analysis in Albania report identified significant barriers and also highlighted opportunities for women in the Elbasan, Puka, and Leskovik municipalities. In response, FAO teamed up with UN Women and local authorities to launch a women-led agribusiness incubator which enables women to prepare and package artisanal products for both domestic and regional markets. While each one of these examples might seem modest in its returns, together they are steps towards implementing context-specific interventions towards enhancing agricultural productivity and economic growth; something with the potential to boost the global economy by USD 1 trillion and reduce food insecurity by 45 million people (FAO, 2023). Cooperatives play a significant role in agrifood systems. Can you share some impactful examples of initiatives that contributed to empower women in the region? Fundamentally, it’s about facilitating rural women’s access to the resources they need to transform their communities and economies. Cooperatives and women-led associations are indispensable because they enable easier access to markets, and financial resources and encourage women to collaborate, share resources, and leverage collective bargaining power, which would otherwise be particularly challenging if carried individually. Let me give an example from Türkiye, where despite challenges from the 2023 earthquake, the FAO-supported Samandağ Women's Cooperative has made remarkable progress. The Cooperative scaled up operations and managed to reduce costs and enhance access to markets. This means they can continue producing and selling local food products like jams and pickles, sustaining livelihoods and strengthening the bonds within their community. Similarly, in Armenia, the 'Berd Bean' Women’s Association addresses the challenges posed by fragmented landholdings, which significantly limit women farmers' ability to reach larger markets. Supported by our ‘Local Empowerment of Actors for Development’ project, this association helps members transition to organic farming. This shift is strategic—it opens doors to premium markets and secure higher incomes for these women. I believe there are some important lessons here that I hope we have collectively learned. Through technical assistance, capacity building, and direct market linkages, and by transforming challenges into opportunities, FAO is creating the conditions for women to succeed, lead and inspire. With the profound impact of climate change on agriculture, what measures is FAO taking to address these challenges for women in the region? Climate change doesn't just alter landscapes; it disproportionately affects the lives of women in agrifood systems. Women are typically more affected by disasters, climate risks, and crises due to discriminatory social norms that limit their access to resources and decision-making roles. To give you an example, findings from the FAO report The Unjust Climate reveal that a 1° C increase in long-term average temperatures can reduce incomes in female-headed households by 34 percent, compared to male-headed households. It’s a priority for FAO to respond to these challenges by integrating women's roles into climate action strategies. Let me give you an example from Bosnia and Herzegovina, where we are empowering women through climate-resilient agricultural practices helping them adopt sustainable farming techniques such as drought-resistant crops and efficient water management systems. Likewise, in Kyrgyzstan, we support women farmers who lead climate-smart initiatives to restore land and enhance forest carbon sequestration. These efforts do more than just provide women with vital skills—they open new economic opportunities and play a crucial role in environmental sustainability. FAO is committed to ensuring that women farmers are equipped to both adapt to climate change and take the lead in mitigating its impacts. Looking ahead to the International Year of the Woman Farmer in 2026, what specific initiatives is FAO planning to further promote women's empowerment in agriculture? As we look forward to the International Year of the Woman Farmer, FAO is ramping up efforts to give greater visibility and celebrate the indispensable role women play in agriculture. We’re planning to expand successful cooperative models, roll-out innovative agricultural technologies designed for women, and enhance our training programs. These steps are designed to improve women’s access to essential resources and leadership roles, aiming for a profound transformation of agrifood systems globally. Our goal is clear: to ensure that women not only participate in but lead the development of efficient, sustainable, resilient and inclusive agrifood systems and their rural environment. Finally, if you could allow us a personal question: this is not the first time we have seen you as a dedicated advocate for equal rights, opportunities, and the empowerment of rural women. What makes these issues particularly important to you on a personal level? Hahaha… I am happy to take the personal question! I deeply believe in equality! Throughout my childhood and part of my adult years, witnessing the implicit discriminatory actions towards my mother, a working woman, and for a long time the sole earner of our household, I have been enraged by such practices and the prevailing inequalities. Since then, and throughout my career I have been an advocate for equality between women and men, and even more so for the empowerment of rural women, whose immense contributions have long been overlooked by our societies.

Many women from rural areas lack the skills needed to pursue livelihoods, decent work, and productive employment. The government in Saudi Arabia is keenly promoting the economic empowerment of rural women to accelerate progress. The transformative role of rural women in sustainable development With technical support from FAO, the Ministry of Water Environment and Agriculture (MEWA) of Saudi Arabia is implementing the Sustainable Rural Agriculture Development (SRAD) programme. The program aims to strengthen capacities, improve rural livelihoods and increase the income of smallholders while conserving vital natural resources. It covers seven value chains - coffee, rose, rainfed cereals, sub-tropical fruits, honeybees, fisheries, and livestock- and works with various stakeholders in the countryside across 11 regions. The purpose is to reinvigorate the agrifood systems by promoting diversification, introducing modern practices, technologies and innovations, increasing skills and capacities, strengthening rural agriculture institutions, and supporting youth and women-led agricultural enterprises to shift from traditional to commercial systems. FAO Saudi Arabia, with partners, showcased the transformative role of rural women in sustainable agricultural development while marking International Rural Women’s Day on 15 October 2024. The event was organized in collaboration with Saudi REEF and the UN Development Programme at the UN House under the theme \" Empowering for a Sustainable Future .\" The event showcased the positive changes in the Saudi countryside through increased agricultural production, value addition, and income generation opportunities for rural families and communities. Six role models of small-scale producers from the rural countryside, Ms. Azza, Ms. Suad, Ms. Aziza, Ms. Sarah, and Ms. Basma, who are based in different regions of Saudi Arabia, were invited to speak about their experiences. They shared experiences, such as starting small enterprises, making bee wax products, jasmine and rose products, and local handicrafts, and becoming successful in their ventures. Previously, these women were trained in value addition within the Warfa Initiative developed under the SRAD project. The initiative promotes agri-preneurship among women and focuses on value-addition efforts. The women at the event discussed their entrepreneurship and showcased several income-generating initiatives such as successful plant nursery businesses; bee wax products like soaps, perfumes and other cosmetics; production of traditional handicrafts and jewellery; traditional recipes using local millets and grains, among others They shared how they had used their skills to support other women. For example, Ms Azza is a model agripreneur and a trendsetter in the plant nursery sector from Baljurashi; Al Baha trained twelve women to establish and manage their own nurseries. The curriculum, developed by FAO and MEWA, covered essential topics such as plant growth, pest control, and business management, providing participants with the practical knowledge required for a plant nursery business startup. Over three months, they learned about soil, water management, the environment, pests, and diseases, and they gained essential knowledge of business management tools and techniques. Azza gladly expressed her gratitude, saying, “I am very satisfied. Thanks to FAO and MEWA, I could share my knowledge of plant nursery business with my sisters.” With newfound horticulture skills and a staunch support network, participants are motivated to establish their plant nursery businesses. The initiative has equipped them with practical skills and proposes innovative business ideas as a sense of community and collaboration. The Power of Peer-to-Peer Learning and Networking The contributions of the rural women entrepreneurs at the International Rural Women’s Day event brought visibility to rural Saudi products and the massive potential for transformation. “With ongoing support from governments and investment agencies, these women can be empowered to make significant contributions to their communities and the agricultural landscape of Saudi Arabia” said Dr. Kakoli Ghosh, CTA of the SRAD Programme. It also made it clear that empowering rural women is essential for individual success as well as to achieve the broader goal of sustainable development in Saudi Arabia and with the transformation of the agrifood systems for better production, better nutrition, a better environment, and a better life for all, ensuring a brighter future."

      "article_text": "Interview with Lauren Phillips, Deputy-Director of FAO’s Rural Transformation and Gender Equality Division Lauren Phillips ( second from left-right), Deputy-Director of FAO’s Rural Transformation and Gender Equality Division, speaks with women farmers during a field visit to India. ©SEWA Rome - Rural communities worldwide are grappling with escalating challenges brought on by the climate crisis. As disasters become more frequent and severe, and environmental conditions grow harsher, the burden on these communities intensifies. However, it is women who are bearing the heaviest brunt of these impacts, including significant financial losses. Until now, no study had ventured to quantify the monetary costs faced by these women due to heat stress, floods, or droughts. The newly released FAO report, The Unjust Climate: Measuring the impacts of climate change on the rural poor, women and youth , sheds light on how climate change disproportionately affects the rural poor, older people and women in low- and middle-income countries. It reveals billions of dollars in losses among female-headed farming households, further widening the income gap between men and women. To delve deeper into the report's findings regarding gender dynamics and the challenges faced by rural women amidst a changing climate, the FAO Newsroom spoke with Lauren Phillips, the Deputy Director of FAO's Rural Transformation and Gender Equality Division. What are the main findings of the FAO report “The Unjust Climate” regarding women? Gender inequality plays a significant role in determining women's adaptive capacity to climate change. Every year, women farmers and female-headed households in low- and middle-income households are suffering from very large losses due to climatic shocks such as heat stress or flooding, surpassing those experienced by male-headed households. This report quantifies some of these losses. So, for example, from heat stress, female-headed households lose 8 percent more of their income every year than male-headed households. And that translates to $37 billion a year. It's a lot of money. Flooding, too, has an impact on decreasing female-headed household income by 3 percent, which is $16 billion a year compared to male-headed households. We are talking about situations in which households are already losing a lot from climate change. But for those that are run by women or on plots that are managed by women, the losses are much greater. The report also finds that if climate change increases by another one degree Celsius, female-headed households could lose 34 percent of their income compared to male-headed households. It's an absolutely huge loss for families that are already suffering from poverty and having trouble having adequate and healthy amounts of food for their families every day. How was FAO able to calculate these numbers? The report uses data from 24 low and middle-income countries across five regions and spans 70 years of daily climate data, matched with the incomes of more than 100,000 households. That means we had data for almost a billion people. What we were able to do was estimate how much greater the losses were for families that were headed by women. For instance, in the event of a drought, how does the situation of a female farmer differ from that of a male farmer? For example, a woman may not have irrigation on her farm. The report we published last year, The status of women in agrifood systems , showed that in countries where there is a higher use of irrigation for farming, women are much less likely to have access to it. So, you can imagine a female farmer without water on her land, and perhaps she also didn't receive new seeds, which could have helped prevent losses from drought. Consequently, she's working harder and longer, putting in an extra hour of work a day compared to a male farmer, trying to adapt to climate change. However, without access to such assets and technologies, she may struggle to keep up with the changing climate. Climate change is also increasing the number of hours women are required to work, and since women already have a higher burden of care in almost all countries worldwide, this exacerbates the situation. On average, women spend 4 hours a day on unpaid domestic and care work, while men spend less than two. This means that climate change can add to the burden of tasks such as gathering water or wood, or any other care duties necessary to keep a household or farming operation running. What are the root causes behind these disparities? In last year’s report, we have analyzed a lot of gender inequalities that are still very persistent. There are gaps in how much money women earn for their work in agriculture and agrifood systems, as well as gaps in the productivity of their land plots, the amount of land they have access to, their access to mobile technologies, and their financial access. But on top of all of this, there are also persistent discriminatory social norms that women and girls face in agrifood systems, which may constrain how much they can work outside the home or how far they can travel to do their work. So, when you combine these material gaps and inequalities with discriminatory social norms, it becomes very hard for women to achieve the same level of outcomes in agrifood systems as men. What can be done to change this? We have a lot of tools at our disposal, and there are a number of successful policy measures. For instance, increasing women's registration and access to land has many benefits on agricultural productivity. It can reduce gender-based violence within households and improve family nutrition. Using an approach that addresses both asset gaps and norms, known as gender transformative approaches, can positively impact how families coordinate work and overall empowerment. Improved empowerment resulting from these approaches can enhance household’s income and resilience. In fact, FAO has estimated - that closing labor and productivity gaps between women and men could significantly impact GDP, increasing it by 1 percent globally and reducing food insecurity for 45 million people. These achievements are possible because we know the successful approaches to empower women in agrifood systems. The report also found that projects and policies focusing on empowerment can majorly improve resilience to climatic and other shocks. It was estimated that empowering projects could lead to an additional 235 million families having higher resilience to such shocks. Therefore, addressing these gaps and promoting empowerment are crucial for helping families and women become more resilient to climate change. What is FAO doing to support rural women in a changing climate? FAO is working in coordination with other UN agencies on the ground in various countries to implement projects that provide better training and capacity building for women. These projects aim to help women participate more in agrifood systems and value chains, as well as gain access to technologies that can address the gaps previously mentioned. Excellent evidence from countries like Ecuador shows how gender-transformative approaches can be used by governments. Additionally, there are outstanding examples worldwide of how capacity building, training women, farmer business schools, and value chain projects can provide significant support. In small island developing countries in the Pacific, such as Palau, FAO has been working to strengthen women's resilience to climate change by focusing on the tourism value chain and other agrifood system work. These countries are highly vulnerable to climate change, and women constitute a significant part of the workforce. Therefore, ensuring that they have the skills, capacities, assets, and resources to prepare for the changing climate is of utmost importance. Is there enough finance going towards supporting rural women in a changing climate? Only 6 percent of bilateral funds focused on agrifood systems are dedicated to making an impact on gender equality and women's empowerment. Clearly, this is not enough. Additionally, in the Unjust Climate report, we examined policies from various countries and found that only 6 percent of national climate policies, known as Nationally Determined Contributions , even mention women in a significant manner. Hence, there's a substantial opportunity to increase attention to gender equality within climate and agricultural policies, thereby attracting more investment to areas where further action is necessary. We consistently collaborate with diverse partners to expand equality. This entails fostering more partnerships and investments, specifically targeting the reduction of gender gaps in agrifood systems and promoting women's empowerment within them. We now have sufficient evidence of effective approaches to address these issues. We should really be looking at the ways that we can combine financing to address multiple challenges. Gender equality should be part of measures to address climate change. We can have a greater impact if we work on both of those objectives at the same time.

      "article_text": "Aquaculture is a marginal and underutilized activity in Gabon while the country struggles to satisfy ever-increasing local demand for fish. ©FAO/Levy Bouassa Levedy Céleste Lossangoye developed a passion for fish farming at an early age. She grew up surrounded by fish ponds on her family’s fish farm in Andem in the Central African country of Gabon. Located around 60 kilometres from Libreville, the country’s capital, her family’s farm has 21 ponds across two hectares and has a production capacity of about 37 tonnes a year. It’s enough to make a comfortable living, but there is untapped potential. Now 30 years old, Céleste is an agricultural engineer with a vision. She is working with her father, Daniel, to turn the family business into a large-scale operation which not only raises tilapia and catfish but also sells their fish directly to people throughout the country. \"The farm has enormous potential to meet local demand, despite the many challenges facing the business,” she says. As in many coastal countries in the Central African region, fish is a popular food source in Gabon. Annual fish consumption is around 35 kilograms per person, one of the highest rates in Africa, but more than 25 000 tonnes of fish have to be imported every year to satisfy the local market. All the while, aquaculture remains a marginal and underutilized activity in Gabon despite the country struggling to satisfy ever-increasing local demand. Since 2017, FAO has been working with the Government of Gabon to further develop commercial aquaculture by establishing five new fishing centres, both maritime and inland fisheries, and enhancing farmers’ skills to increase production. Additionally, after conducting research on the needs of fish farmers, FAO conducted training courses in three provinces – Estuaire, Oyem and Bitam – to build the technical capacity, production skills and business know-how of young male and female entrepreneurs including Céleste. Topics included the selection of fish farming sites, the manufacture and assembly of floating cages, production techniques and improving quality broodstock for tilapia and catfish. “We learnt how to make floating cages, which can add value to what we already have. It’s something we can use to increase our production because we already have ponds,” says Céleste. “Aquaculture in Gabon is still at an early stage and does not contribute significantly to food security, but the development of aquaculture offers real job opportunities for young people,” says Lionel Kinadjian, FAO fisheries and aquaculture officer. “The demand is there as well as the environmental conditions to promote aquaculture.” FAO and the Government of Gabon are building the capacity of fish farms and encouraging youth to get involved in aquaculture to address unemployment rates and take advantage of the increasing local demand for fish. ©FAO/Bob Inanga Manana Siengoy An opportunity for youth employment Many young graduates are struggling to find a job in Gabon where youth unemployment is running as high as 38 percent, according to the International Labour Organization. FAO believes the fisheries and aquaculture sector offers enormous potential to create jobs, especially for youth, and to meet the challenge of food security and nutrition. \"Aquaculture is a profitable activity that allows you to feed your family and provide for your financial needs,\" says Céleste. “I urge unemployed people to get involved.” According to the latest data, there are 423 farmers practising aquaculture and fish farming in Gabon, but only 22.7 percent are under the age of 35. In addition to aquaculture production, FAO supports this outreach to youth by offering workshops on aquaculture investment and decision making to enhance business plans. It also provided participants with fish farming and harvesting equipment. Yannick Mve Obiang, a 27-year-old fish farmer who produces catfish and tilapia, says the FAO course gave him skills and insights to modernise his ponds and move from subsistence farming to commercial production. But in Gabon, the sector faces constraints, such as a lack of available fish food or quality fingerlings at an affordable price as well as the absence of investment capital. “A lack of availability of quality basic inputs makes it difficult for the sector to attract new investors and meet the government’s objectives to double national fish production, reaching 50 000 tonnes by 2025,” says Kinadjian. “We placed great emphasis on the vision of aquaculture as a business, which should make it possible to ensure the profitability and sustainability of activities and to mobilize finance outside development projects or government donations.” With training and inputs provided by FAO, youth like Céleste (pictured above) are securing a livelihood in aquaculture that can support them and their families into the future. ©FAO/Bob Inanga Manana Siengoy Growing farms to meet rising demand Céleste is enthusiastic about playing a greater role in the management of her family’s fish farm. \"I have decided to invest myself in the farm, to help my father improve the technical aspects, the production and the marketing of our products and to improve the profitability of our activity,\" she says. “My long-term vision is to see Lossangoye fish shops spring up all over the city of Libreville and to become the number one fish farm in Gabon.” In Gabon and several other Central African countries, FAO supports agricultural programmes that enable young people to build their capacity and engage in more productive and profitable activities helping them secure a more resilient and sustainable future.

      "article_text": "Several low- and middle-income countries have demonstrated significant progresses in measuring and promoting women’s empowerment in agriculture © FAO/Haji Dirir Thanks to the Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index ( WEAI ) , an aggregate index launched in 2012 that measures the empowerment, agency, and inclusion of women in the agricultural sector. Combining data from interviews with women and men in the same household, the index has evolved through multiple versions containing different number of indicators and modules, having been used by over 230 organizations across 58 countries. To mark ten years since its launch, development institutions reported the outcomes and lessons from the field experiences using WEAI during a virtual event held by FAO and partners on 24 March 2022, at the sidelines of the 66 th Session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW66). Speakers highlighted how impactful the use of the WEAI has been in different countries, sharing examples from Bangladesh and Africa. The United States Agency for International Development’s (USAID) Feed the Future programme in Bangladesh adapted its activities in terms of gender, after conducting a pioneering WEAI-based survey in 2012 that indicated that only one in three women in Bangladesh were empowered. “This was the first time we had a benchmark to measure progress and guide our work. And we have tailored our approach to help women reach their full potential,” said Randy Ali, Deputy Mission Director at USAID-Bangladesh, explaining how reshaping their work brought very satisfying outcomes. “In 2019, we witnessed remarkable changes: two out of three women were empowered and gender parity significantly increased. The index has been a valuable tool to help us track this progress.” In its pilot phase, the WEAI was used in the International Food Policy Research Institute ’s (IFPRI) Bangladesh Integrated Household Survey (BIHS), which provided findings about the nexus between women’s empowerment and Zero Hunger at national scale. “When we analyzed the data, we found how much women’s empowerment improves household nutrition, promotes agricultural diversity and helps people move out of poverty,” said Akhter Ahmed, Country Representative at IFPRI-Bangladesh. “Solid evidence is very important for including women’s empowerment and gender issues in policy.” Findings from the BIHS were then used to design another study called the Agriculture, Nutrition, and Gender Linkages (ANGel), a three-year initiative that aimed to identify actions and investments in agriculture to promote agricultural diversity, increase farm household income, improve nutrition, and empower women. “The Ministry of Agriculture is now scaling up the best practices from the ANGel’s findings in hundreds of upazilas (Bangladesh administrative regions),” celebrated Md. Zahidul Hassan, Managing Director at Data Analysis and Technical Assistance (DATA). Dr. Shirin Sharmin Chaudhury, Speaker of Bangladesh’s Parliament, shared her optimism about the potential of the WEAI since her remarks at the inauguration of the index in 2012. “It was the first of its kind to directly measure women’s empowerment in agriculture. Now, after ten years of using this tool in Bangladesh, I am pleased to share that we have learned so much about women’s empowerment and how it is linked to important outcomes in agriculture and nutrition. I am even more pleased that this information has been used to design and implement gender- and nutrition-sensitive agricultural programmes in Bangladesh,” stated Dr. Chaudhury, the first-ever woman to lead Bangladesh’s legislative chamber. ‘Mainstream policy making’ in Africa References were made to African countries, where many are dedicated to measuring and promoting women’s empowerment. Dr. Pranati Mohanraj, Deputy Director of Gender, Youth and Livelihoods, Food and Water Systems at CARE USA , highlighted that her organization has used WEAI metrics to measure progress on women’s empowerment in the context of various projects in Ghana, Tanzania, Mali and Malawi. While acknowledging the need for more gender-disaggregated data, Lizzie Chikoti, Acting Commissioner of Malawi’s National Statistical Office, emphasized that in the future, her institution plans to embed such data in more national surveys. Paulina Addy, Director for Women in Agricultural Development at Ghana’s Ministry of Food and Agriculture, acknowledged that her country has come a “long way with women’s empowerment” and underlined the key role of metrics systems, commending IFPRI for “spearheading the implementation of the WEAI.” John Ulimwengu, Senior Research Fellow at IFPRI, noted a widespread understanding by African heads of state that “the road to agricultural transformation goes through women’s empowerment because more than 60 percent of those feeding Africa are women”. He highlighted that 31 out of 55 African countries are using WEAI or WEAI-like metrics to measure women’s empowerment. “We do not look the WEAI just as an index. It is part of the mainstream policy making in agricultural development across the continent,” complemented Mr. Ulimwengu, who is involved in research and policy advisory on issues related to the implementation of the African Union’s Comprehensive Africa Agricultural Development Program (CAADP).

      "article_text": "In the past ten years there have been tremendous efforts to develop methodologies and tools to measure women’s empowerment in the context of agriculture in a comprehensive and standardized way ©FAO/K. Pratt Perhaps the most prominent among those efforts is the Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index (WEAI), a ground-breaking tool launched in 2012 that aims to measure women’s (and men’s) agency, empowerment and inclusion in the agricultural sector. To mark 10 years since its launch, WEAI experts, high-level officials and members of grassroots organizations shared their views and experiences working on women’s empowerment and the importance to measure it during a virtual side event held on 24 March 2022 at the sidelines of the 66 th Session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW66). Nearly 250 participants followed the session Measuring What Matters: 10 Years of the Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index, why has it mattered, and what’s next? , co-hosted by FAO, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Through live exchanges and pre-recorded testimonies, speakers elaborated on the gender-based constraints in rural contexts, emphasizing how critical measuring women’s empowerment is to identify gender gaps more accurately, substantiate research, and motivate the development of better-targeted gender-responsive policies and programmes for Zero Hunger. Participants also mentioned the benefits of empowering women not only for women themselves but also for households and communities in terms of food security and better nutrition and beyond. “Women’s empowerment enhances overall development in the society,” summarized in a video testimony Dorcas Njuki, who became a female community leader in Kenya’s Nakuru County after gaining advocacy and leadership skills through the local women-focused movement GROOTS . In India, video stories from the Self Employed Women's Association (SEWA) illustrated how women can thrive in business through capacity development, engagement and solidarity: “Through SEWA, I got an opportunity to learn several new things like agricultural modernization. I pass on these learnings to poor and marginal sister farmers,” said in one of these video stories Seemaben Padhiyar, a smallholder woman farmer in Anand district who helped link about 90,000 poor informal workers to the Indian government’s e-shram, a newly launched social security scheme. Gender statistics are key to make women visible in agri-food systems Given the two-way links between gender inequality and food insecurity, international development organizations such as FAO rely on gender data to better understand the different constraints women and men face in agriculture and food systems, in order to formulate programmes and projects that are gender sensitive to promote sustainable, efficient and inclusive agri-food systems for food security and nutrition. However, finding sufficient data is often a major challenge. “The continued scarcity of sex-disaggregated data and gender statistics hinders a comprehensive understanding of rural women’s and men’s roles, status and contributions in agri-food systems. It also prevents an understanding of the gendered distribution of benefits from participating in agri-food systems, and thus it hinders the design of gender-responsive and transformative policies to achieve sustainable development” stated Máximo Torero, FAO Chief Economist. “Without complete accurate data, entire groups of people are invisible to us. All too often they are the ones we most need to see. And all too often they are women,” highlighted Samantha Power, USAID Administrator, who called for an increased use of the WEAI to expand data availability and make the index a mainstream methodological reference point. “Together, we can make women’s empowerment a top priority and close the gender data gap in agriculture. If we expand the WEAI, streamline it, improve it, if we measure what is hard to measure, we will not just make women visible, we will serve them, we will empower them, we will learn from them, we will prove that they matter.” “If the goal is to end hunger, we cannot do it without understanding the needs of women. After all, they are doing much of the food production in places with a high concentration of hunger, and we know they face many challenges men do not,” said Enock Chikava, Interim Director of Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation’s Agricultural Development Team. The index at a glance Launched in 2012, the Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture Index ( WEAI) aims to measure women’s and men’s agency, empowerment and inclusion in the agricultural sector. The tool is made of two sub-indices: the Five Domains of Empowerment (5DE), which measures production, resources, income, leadership and time; and the Gender Parity Index (GPI), which examines a woman’s empowerment relative to the man within their household. “It is quite different from other indices because it interviews both men and women in the same household,” stressed Agnes Quisumbing, Senior Research Fellow at IFPRI, one of the developers of the WEAI who has worked on it since its creation ten years ago. In light of other existing measures, she added, the WEAI’s strength is about measuring people’s agency – “the ability to make important choices and to act on them”. The index was first piloted in three countries – Bangladesh, Guatemala and Uganda. Since then multiple versions of the WEAI have been developed containing different number of indicators and modules to fit diverse projects and objectives. It has been adopted and adapted by over 230 organizations across 58 countries. Looking ahead Panelists agreed that, despite the perceived progresses on measuring women’s empowerment, many efforts are still needed to ensure sufficient data availability, hence enabling more efficient development strategies and actions. “Policy-makers are not demanding data that is focused on women’s empowerment or gender equality. We need to sensitize policy-makers about these issues, and then we will hopefully see an increase (in the use of such data),” highlighted Athur Mabiso, Senior Technical Specialist at IFAD, who also called for more investments in capacity development to increase the available expertise on data collection. Given its innovative value and success, the WEAI has set the basis for the Women’s Empowerment Metric for National Statistical Systems (WEMNS), a new system that is being developed by IFPRI and Emory University in close collaboration with the 50x2030 Initiative to Close the Agricultural Data Gap , of which FAO, IFAD and the World Bank are implementing partners. Recognizing the increasing livelihood diversification in developing economies, WEMNS will be applicable to both agricultural and non-agricultural livelihoods. “These next ten years will be important to scaling up empowerment metrics and their use by development practitioners worldwide,” concluded Jemimah Njuki, Chief of Women’s Economic Empowerment at UN Women, who moderated the event.

      "article_text": "Held on the sidelines of CSW66, representatives from the UN Rome-based Agencies and UN Women strongly recommitted to implementing interventions to carry out holistic and integrated interventions for rural women. ©UN Women/Narendra Shrestha Empowering women with a systematic consideration of climate issues has set the tone for the newly launched phase of the Joint Programme on Accelerating Progress towards Rural Women’s Economic Empowerment (JP RWEE), a United Nations multi-country partnership that aims to secure rural women’s livelihoods, rights and resilience to advance sustainable development. “This new phase builds extensively on the learnings generated from the first phase of the programme, and has been strengthened with a climate resilience lens across interventions,” announced Elizabeth Burges-Sims, Deputy Director of Gender at the World Food Programme (WFP), formally launching the second phase of the JP RWEE at a virtual event on 23 March 2022. Over the next five years, the Joint Programme will continue to count on the “unique partnership”, as defined by Ms. Burges-Sims, between the three UN Rome-based Agencies (RBAs) – the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), and the World Food Programme (WFP) – and UN Women , supported by Norway and Sweden. During the event, held on the sidelines of the 66th Session on the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW), representatives from the implementing agencies and resource partners renewed their firm commitment to carry out holistic and integrated interventions for rural women, including the most marginalized, encompassing social, economic and political domains of empowerment. “The lessons and good practices from the first phase – such as incorporating a resilience lens across the programme, ensuring strategies to engage both men and boys, applying gender transformative approaches with local governments as well as rural households, and establishing uniform monitoring and evaluation systems from the beginning and across the whole programme – were incorporated in the design of the second phase we are launching today,” stressed Ndaya Beltchika, IFAD’s Lead Technical Specialist for Gender Targeting and Social inclusion. From 2022, activities will take place initially across Nepal, Niger, the Pacific Islands, Tanzania and Tunisia thanks to approximately USD 25 million generously committed by Norway and Sweden, both of whom have continuously supported the JP RWEE from its beginning in 2014. The programme has a view to scaling up activities to additional countries in the near future. The first phase of the programme was implemented in Ethiopia, Guatemala, Kyrgyzstan, Liberia, Nepal, Niger and Rwanda from 2014 to 2021 and reached nearly 80,000 rural people – about 80 percent of whom were women. The participants achieved, on average, an 82 percent increase in agricultural production, generated over USD 3.6 million from on-farm and off-farm sales and almost USD 2 million through savings and loan schemes. Programme results also showed greater economic autonomy for rural women, more gender equitable household relations and increased numbers of women in leadership positions. Changing the way of thinking When social norms hinder women from enjoying the same opportunities as men, both women and their communities, including men, will be losing much bigger opportunities at the end of the day. They will lose in terms of household income, community progress, food and nutrition security, social prosperity and welfare. In its holistic approach, the JP RWEE has worked to tackle deep-rooted causes of gender inequalities, inducing communities to critically reflect on their social norms and pursue more equitable and inclusive behaviours. Before joining the programme in 2018, 49-year-old Nasira Khaturn from Nepal was forced to stay home doing household chores. Her father-in-law and her husband would not allow her to leave freely. “I felt like I was imprisoned,” recalls Nasira. “If I went outside without permission, my husband would beat me.” Thanks to a gender transformative training offered by the JP RWEE, her situation started to improve as well as her household’s dynamics, economic condition and family’s well-being. “When I came back from the training, I shared with my relatives the plan and pathways to improve our family’s situation. How we can work together to earn money, how we can plan together for our family’s future. It improved my relationship with my family members, helping break barriers down and increasing mutual understanding,” explained Nasira, who also learned more about nutrition and climate-smart farming techniques. After the training, her productivity increased and she started to earn her own income. Feeling empowered and having gained leadership skills, Nasira has become a community leader who facilitates changes in her neighbourhood. “We are now sharing what we learned with others in the community.” Women and climate risks Incorporating a climate lens throughout the JP RWEE’s new interventions demonstrates its recognition of how gender and climate issues intertwine in various ways, and how a holistic approach integrating both can result in accelerating empowerment and sustainable development. As mentioned during the event, climate change can affect women and men differently, and ignoring these gender-based differences can curb development progresses. “Research shows that increased temperatures and climate-related disasters slow progress towards the improvement of women’s economic and social rights. However, the sort of good news is that participatory processes can help to temper those effects,” pointed out Lauren Phillips, Deputy Director at FAO’s Inclusive Rural Transformation and Gender Equality Division. “Having women participating in processes can help to improve economic and social rights despite the challenges that climate change presents.” One of the new countries of operation for the Joint Programme is Tanzania, where subsistence agriculture is source of livelihood for about 80 percent of women and where 95 percent of agricultural activities depend on rainfall. “Rural livelihoods are increasingly threatened by unpredictable weather patterns, including temperature increases, increased frequency of droughts and rainfall variability. We are seeing these weather patterns impacting on women’s livelihoods through reduced crop yields, which in turn impacts household food consumption,” said Hodan Addou, UN Women Country Representative in Tanzania. In the Pacific Islands, a set of low-lying small countries particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, the JP RWEE will replicate good practices from its previous experiences in other regions while learning and adapting to the local context and its specific fragilities. Although women can be disproportionally at risk to climate change in the Pacific Islands and beyond, they should not be labelled as powerless, to avoid generalizing and inadvertently disempowering them. “Women are not just vulnerable, we are not just victims. We have skills and abilities that are really valuable for an effective response,” highlighted Karen Mapusua, Director for the Land Resources Division at The Pacific Community. “While rural women’s existing challenges may have been exacerbated, and will continue to be exacerbated by climate change, women are also leading the way and using their knowledge and existing skills to adapt and mitigate to the increasingly changing context.” What is expected from Phase 2 “Given the proven structure of the programme, we see a large potential of not only drawing on learnings, approaches and tools, but also considering making it a standardized programme offered by UN country agencies at all levels”, said Lotta Sylwander, Lead Policy Specialist Gender at the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida). In her view, the programme could be replicated across countries whose governments show stronger ownership and willingness to strengthen women’s economic empowerment along with climate adaptation. Astrid T. Tveteraas, Head of Section for Climate, Energy and Environment at the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD), considers the JP RWEE as “a great vehicle to improve rural women’s livelihoods,” as corroborated by the evaluation of the Phase 1, through improved agricultural practices, market linkages, awareness-raising and leadership building. “We believe that the second phase is a great opportunity to apply these lessons learned to achieve systemic change,” added Ms. Tveteraas, while encouraging other potential donors to come on board and help catalyze changes.

Nearly 100 attendees followed the event moderated by Zitouni Ould-Dada, Deputy Director of FAO’s Office of Climate Change, Biodiversity and Environment. Researchers, practitioners and activists spoke up against the deep-rooted systemic practices enduring gender inequalities and youth exclusion within the negotiations around climate action. Panellists called for a turnaround in the ways negotiations are currently held to overcome the common under-representation of women in national delegations and ensure that women’s and youth’s voices are effectively listened and pondered. Maria Helena Semedo, FAO Deputy Director-General, called for more investments in strengthening women’s and youth’s skills in leadership negotiation and business. “Empowering, engaging and giving voice to women and youth, will allow new economic opportunities and markets to flourish,” said Ms. Semedo, a lead advocate for gender issues who chairs FAO Women’s Committee, an inclusive volunteer-based initiative made of FAO’s female workforce. “We have seen that when women and youth participate at the political level, there is a greater responsiveness to citizens’ needs. Including women and youth at the leadership level results in more effective climate-related projects and policies.” “We have first to admit that the system has failed women” underlined Nicoline de Haan, Director of the CGIAR GENDER Platform, transcribing the empirical evidence about gender and climate. “There is a lot of pressure on women to solve everything. But the system is not there yet. Women do not have the required tools. So let us first find out what the issues are and how can we solve them, but at the same time, find solutions that on Monday morning will help a woman deal with climate change. And let us not just keep talking.” Rachel Allen, FAO Coordinator for Gender and Climate Change, gave passionate emphasis to the urgent need for gender-transformative changes: “Saying to women to come into the room and take a seat… You cannot take a seat that was not built for you in the first place,” voiced Ms. Allen. “Let us throw the table out! Let us rebuild the table with gender diversity, racial diversity, cultural diversity, having indigenous women and men on it, having men and women with disabilities on it, and then really start to build a microcosm of what our world, the ‘real world’, looks like. And then we will find honest and authentic solutions to a lot of the climate change issues that we face.” “This important issue of representation and leadership of women should not just be left up to women to sort out,” acknowledged Fleur Newman, Gender Focal Point at the UN Climate Change Secretariat. “Addressing barriers to women's full and equal engagement and contribution to climate policy and action starts at the top. And often at the top – whether in governments, companies or organizations – there are not necessarily women leading already. So, there is definitely a role for men, particularly men in leadership positions, to lead on gender equality, but also on applying a climate lens and looking at themselves and their own organizations and their own sphere of influence in order to make change.” Youth inclusion, education and alternative forums According to a study by Brookings Institution, girls’ education can lead to powerful climate solutions by fostering their climate leadership and pro-environmental decision-making. Research has found a moderate correlation between the number of women delegates involved in climate negotiations and their countries’ respective rates of education for girls. In other words, more years of schooling for girls may result in greater women’s leadership in the global climate talks. Furthermore, studies suggest that women are more likely to make decisions that favour environmental conservation and protection. “We need more women leaders. This will definitely happen with girls’ education, where they feel empowered,” highlighted Henrietta Wood, Member of YouNGO’s Women and Gender Working Group, who backed transformative changes in social norms as a way to expand girls’ access to education. “Inspiring women to become leaders in their homes, communities and even countries, cannot be achieved by an unjust education system. The education system needs to cultivate wisdom, motivation and an emancipation from traditional roles which are fueling the barriers holding women back”. Carla Madueño, Ecologist and Climate Youth Activist at the Youth in Landscapes Initiative, applauded the role of alternative fora that bring light to outweighed issues affecting marginalized views, including women’s. “These different platforms give underrepresented groups like youth or female leaders a voice and a stake. Perhaps these emerging spaces are new decision-making tables that we shall not underestimate because these are parallel spaces of power that certainly have a great contribution to provide to leaders,” said Ms. Madueño, who is a member of one of such fora. “There are some improvements, but not enough. We have created new spaces and opportunities, but the statistics show that we are not there yet. There are issues with culture and the system, as well as opportunities to rebuild something new where everyone can take part of, instead of building something that includes only part of the society,” concluded Mr Ould-Dada.

      "article_text": "66th Session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW66): Side event by FAO, Mountain Partnership and Slow Food International @FAO/Jesse Alpert Experts and practitioners made the case to promote sustainable tourism across the Small Islands Developing States (SIDS) and empower women at a virtual event on 16 March 2022 organized by FAO, the Mountain Partnership and Slow Food International in collaboration with the government of Palau and the UN World Tourism Organization (UNWTO). Around 140 attendees joined this interactive session moderated by Angelica Jácome Daza, Director of FAO’s Office of Small Island Developing States, Least Developed Countries and Landlocked Developing Countries. Speakers championed ecofriendly and gender-sensitive practices in the tourism sector in SIDS countries, as a way to protect their fragile ecosystems, while attracting foreign visitors who can contribute to fostering local jobs, incomes and women’s empowerment. In line with this call, the event showcased an innovative project implemented in Palau through partnership between FAO, Sustainable Travel International , Slow Food International and the Palau Bureau of Tourism , to make this Pacific island one of the world’s first carbon neutral destination. The endeavour is part of the subprogramme Empowering food systems and strengthening the local capacities and resilience of SIDS in the agrifood sector , funded by several resource partners under FAO’s Flexible Multi-partner Mechanism . The initiative will tackle climate change and boost community resilience by neutralizing tourism’s carbon footprint, improving the livelihoods of local food producers, increasing local food security; while empowering women to better participate in the tourism value chains and conserving coastal ecosystems that act as carbon sinks. “As we recover from COVID-19 and its devastating impact on our tourism economy, we are really looking to build back in a more circular and thoughtful way,” stressed H.E. Ilana Seid, Palau Ambassador to the United Nations. “By implementing programmes that address various Sustainable Development Goals concurrently, we hope that our path forward is one that is not only more secure and more prosperous, but also more equitable to women.” Not any tourism, but one that is sustainable and inclusive Significantly dependent on tourism, SIDS’ economies are among the worst affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, which disrupted international travels. In 2020, their Gross Domestic Product dropped by 6.9% versus 4.8% in all other developing countries, according to estimates from the International Monetary Fund. Despite their economic need to recover the flows of tourists as fast as possible, SIDS have been encouraged to transform the sector by mainstreaming gender and environmentally sustainable practices to protect themselves, including their economies, in the long-term. “Women make a significant contribution in the tourism sector to service provision, employment and as farmers and entrepreneurs. Yet they continue to face structural constraints that prevent them from fully developing that potential,” said Ismahane Elouafi, FAO Chief Scientist. “We need to translate our talk about gender equality into policies. CSW66 is an occasion to spark the necessary changes to empower rural woman. The tourism sector provides a great opportunity for women to access decent paying jobs, create assets and wealth and boost their productivities and incomes.” Promoting resilience, health, equality and indigenous values Because of their fragile ecosystems and populations particularly vulnerable to climate change, isolation and limited food availability and economic opportunities, SIDS could greatly benefit from investments targeting practices that are both sustainable and attractive to foreign tourists, acknowledged RosaLaura Romeo, Programme Coordinator at the Mountain Partnership. “Tourists want to see the local culture. They want to experience the local traditions. This is why it is so important to continue protecting the traditional food systems while promoting healthy and balanced diets.” In a similar, yet critical perspective on the SIDS’ food culture, Michele Rumiz, Director of Slow Food Travel, rebuked the economic logic perpetuating their overreliance on foods that are not local and often not healthy. “Palau and all the small islands across the world are suffering from climate change and unfair and unjust food systems that basically make them extremely dependent on imports of staple products. So, the way they feed themselves is also contributing to exacerbate the problem of climate change.” In closing, Dirk Glaesser, Director of UNWTO’s Sustainable Development Department, called for transformative change towards preventing global crises like COVID-19 and its knock-on effects that cause even larger difficulties to those who already face the burden of inequalities. “If tourism development business is not sustainably managed, it can lead both to increase gender inequality as well as damaging environmental impact. Tourism's role in the economic transition towards a green and blue economy in SIDS must therefore be gender responsive.” WATCH EVENT Passcode: ERW2022+"

      "article_text": "Young farmer Ruramiso Mashumba is spearheading change in Zimbabwe Ruramiso is somewhat of a rarity in Zimbabwe: she’s young, female and a farm owner. “Very few women actually own land,” she says. “Even though agriculture is so rewarding and there are lots of opportunities to develop the sector in Zimbabwe.” One thing she wants to pass on to farmers in the region is her knowledge of Conservation Agriculture (CA): a sustainable way of farming that makes irrigation systems more efficient and minimises soil disturbance. “I’m really keen to share my ideas with others and encourage knowledge transfer: I think these kinds of exchanges are incredibly important.” As part of this approach she trains women in numerous CA techniques, including the use of ground cover and crop rotation to prevent the build-up of weeds. “I believe the future of agriculture lays in the hands of those that are given custody of the land and are responsible for treating it in a way that future generations will benefit from,” she says. When it comes to COVID-19, she says the pandemic has exposed a lot of vulnerabilities in rural communities. She thinks that these hard times have made people view essential workers differently. “All of a sudden people realise that food doesn’t just appear in shops: so many work tirelessly to make that food available.” According to Ruramiso, the current situation has also exposed Zimbabwe’s need for investment, within agriculture and more generally. She says that food systems in Zimbabwe are also lagging behind owing to of lack of technology and mechanisation. Support is needed for the adoption of such technologies, and she hopes that in the next five years Southern African agriculture will see a rise in investments. Ruramiso isn’t afraid to admit that she aims to be at the forefront of change in her country, particularly when it comes to helping women and youth in agriculture. “My hope is for a brighter tomorrow,” she says.

All of us, regardless if we are men or women, should raise our voices for women rights and gender equality,” said Mr Md. Mahbub Alam Talukder, the Refugee, Relief and Repatriation Commissioner of the Government of Bangladesh, while delivering his speech as the Chief Guest. “The relation between men and women should not be based on domination, but on love, compassion and cooperation so that we progress together,” he added. Mr Abul Kashem, Deputy Director, Department of Agricultural Extension emphasized the contribution women have made at both the household and national level through agricultural activities. Lucky Sharma, the leader of one of the FAO-supported women farmers’ group in Cox’s Bazar, proudly shared her group’s experience, “we are working in the field and our farmers are introducing new technologies, which are being adopted by the whole community, including men farmers.” “Learning from FAO Farmer Field Schools, our farmers are now using vermicompost instead of chemical fertilizer”, she added. The speakers and community leaders urged everyone to take collective action in achieving gender equality. Government officials appreciated FAO’s work in reducing hunger and enhancing the agri-food system by empowering women and closing the gender group. “FAO is currently supporting 25 000 farming households, including at least 30 percent who are women, in Cox’s Bazar. Women’s empowerment has been pursued as a strategy to ensure leadership and meaningful representation of women and marginalized communities,” said Malika Budanaeva, Emergency Operation Office of FAO. The event concluded with a common pledge to work together for women’s empowerment and gender equality, reflecting on this year International Women Day’s theme 'I am Generation Equality: Realising Women's Rights.’"

      "article_text": "While rice cultivation thrives, villagers, especially women, earned a living along the rice production value chain, working as parboilers, millers and marketers. The Jere Bowl is an irrigated land mass formed by the flow of the Ngadda River in Jere local government area (LGA), Borno State, in Nigeria . Susceptibility to flooding , resulting in a perennially moist soil even during dry season, makes the area favourable to rice cultivation . In communities like Zabarmari and Gongulong located in the Jere Bowl, farmers plant rice on very large scales twice a year – during both rainy and dry seasons. While rice cultivation thrives, villagers, especially women, earned a living along the rice production value chain, working as parboilers, millers and marketers. However, the competitive advantage of rural actors in the value chain is attenuated by challenges, such as the absence of mechanization, poor knowledge of modern rice processing and packaging methods, and limited access to markets. The situation was further worsened by a decade-long regional armed conflict , which has dislodged farmers from their communities and worsened food security conditions. “Even before the crisis, most people who come to buy rice paddy did not let us parboil for them. The crisis has made business harder and patronage poor”, said 50-year-old Falmata Mustapha, a rice processor from Gongulong. Old but not gold “Wufatu is the only method of processing rice that we know”, she said. An age-long local technique of processing rice paddy before milling, wufatu is a common practice among rural rice processors in Jere. Rice paddy is boiled for 24 hours, sun-dried for three days and milled to remove the bran layer and husk. Wufatu is a cumbersome and resource-consuming process. Falmata shared that she uses at least 200 litres of water and about NGN 1 000 (USD 3) worth of firewood to process 50 kg of rice, making the process environmentally unsustainable and expensive. Wufatu also subjects women to health hazards as they constantly monitor the boiling paddy, exposing them to firewood smoke. “If I process a lot of rice, I usually have to treat cough”, she explains, stating she does not know if she has health issues as a result of over-exposure to smoke and the absence of functional health centres where she can be examined.

While the disease is endemic in Yemen, the last few years have seen infections spike to a scale not witnessed in living memory. The destruction of water infrastructure due to the conflict, plus aquifer depletion, are largely to blame. With freshwater extremely scarce and sewage disposal systems in disrepair, more and more people are using water of dubious quality. A still visibly frail Adba suspects she contracted cholera from water from Sana'a's wastewater treatment plant. The overwhelmed plant is spewing poorly treated wastewater into the canal that runs through the Bani Al Harith District, where Adba lives with her daughter and three grandchildren.

The province of Batha in Chad is one of the most isolated and prone to the Sahel ’s extreme climate variations from one year to another. Since there is only one productive season per year, the effects of climate variability are causing a precarious food security situation in a country already facing widespread poverty. Families are forced to separate so the men can bring the animals from grazing areas to markets while leaving the women to take care of the children and of the provision of food . Households are therefore not able to diversify their diets and cannot adequately cover basic needs. The global acute malnutrition rate is close to 17 percent, which is almost double the prevalence threshold established by the World Health Organization . In response, FAO is collaborating with the International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) to identify the best options to allow these families to provide for themselves and better anticipate immediate food and nutrition risks while creating the opportunities to improve their living conditions over the long term.

Adut and her daughter Angong could often only feed her with asida, a dish made out of ground sorghum. She wasn’t getting all the nutrients she needed from her food, and the way the food was washed also left her susceptible to food-borne illnesses that stopped absorption of nutrients and further weakened her body. “When I held her in my arms, she was so thin that I thought she could not make it. I always prayed for her to survive,” Adut recalls with tears in her eyes. Adut lives in Marial Ajith community in northwestern South Sudan . This area is very fertile and has plenty of rivers and basins. Agricultural production used to be high and vegetables were exported from the region to the rest of South Sudan. Years of conflict , however, made this area a dangerous place to harvest the land; many people left their homes and lost their livelihoods. Insecurity and violence had turned this place into a deeply food insecure area, reliant on humanitarian aid. Like many other women in South Sudan, Adut and Angong lost their husbands and brothers to the conflict. They never returned to Marial Ajith. But with FAO’s help, Adut and the other women are doing their part to realize the community’s potential. In late 2018, FAO, with funding of the Governments of the Netherlands and Norway , started helping mothers enhance and diversify the diets of their children to fight malnutrition . As part of the project, the women first received vouchers to procure nutritious food items, such as milk, meat, fish and assorted vegetables that they and their children were missing in their diets. They also received trainings on how to properly wash, cook and preserve various types of food.

In short, the initiative focuses on putting in place rainwater retention systems in the Sahel where access to water is a challenge: rainfall here is increasingly irregular, accentuating periods of drought in contrast with floods ; wells, when they exist, are often far from those who have to use them; and water is expensive. Without water, food security is not possible. How does it work? The system itself is quite simple. A shed with a zinc roof collects rainwater in a drain connected with two pipes. One of these discharges dirty water from the first rains cleaning the roof of the shed. This water cannot be used for consumption, but is perfectly suitable for irrigation . Once the roof of the shed is clean, the first pipe is closed, while the second is opened and pours rainwater into the cistern and this can be used for consumption. This system is based on an initiative implemented in Brazil, in semi-arid areas similar to the Sahel region. Some will define this innovative approach as integrated and others as resilient. After a good three-hour drive, we arrive in the rural community of Thiamène Pass, located in northwestern Senegal, and more precisely, in the village of Douli. There are about 20 women , all extremely elegant, wearing colourful dresses, their children and grandchildren, and some men. It is hot, very hot – we are in the Sahel. Everyone is patient under the shed with the zinc roof that is an integral part of the system. We start to ask our questions, sitting under the shed – the only shadow area around us, making it a place to socialize. Learn more"

Impacts of El Niño El Niño conditions started developing in the last quarter of 2018, and by February 2019 the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) upgraded the status from “El Niño Watch” to “El Niño”. This indicated that a weak El Niño was present and that drought and dry spells would likely persist through August 2019. The National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council’s latest report from May 2019 indicates that a total of 393 455 people have already been affected, mostly in Mindanao. Reports of damage to agriculture have amounted to more than USD 153.3 million (PHP 7.96 billion), affecting 247 610 farmers. In addition, a total of 43 local government units have declared States of Calamity due to the dry spell. Learn more"

Photo: ©FAO/Soliman Ahmed / FAO The European Union (EU) has contributed new funding totalling $40.8 million to boost United Nations (UN) resilience-building work in Yemen. Interventions will target the most vulnerable community groups, including women, the unemployed, youth, marginalized minority groups, internally displaced persons (IDPs) and stressed host communities. The funding agreement, which has been recently signed in Amman, will support the second phase of the UN Enhanced Rural Resilience in Yemen Programme , which covers a 36-month period and aims to reduce communities' vulnerability to shocks and crises in the conflict-ridden country, which is facing the world's largest humanitarian crisis. Targetting over vulnerable 735 000 people, the programme will be implemented jointly by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the International Labour Organization (ILO), the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the World Food Programme (WFP). \"The EU continues its efforts in creating the conditions for sustainable development and supporting key basic services to help Yemeni citizens endure the worst crisis they have ever lived. We are confident that this initiative will contribute to resilience-building work in Yemen, by targeting most vulnerable groups of the Yemeni society. The EU remains close to Yemeni citizens throughout the whole country.\" said the EU Head of Delegation, Antonia Calvo Puerta. The FAO-led components of the programme will receive $9 million from the total EU funds and will target more than 370 000 vulnerable people. Some of the programme's interventions will include the provision of improved seeds, livestock feed for animals and small equipment, for example, solar powered irrigation pumps. Small-scale dairy product producers will be supported with improved equipment and training to improve the quality and quantity of their products. The Programme will also support sheep fattening for small businesses and animal health services. As part of its value chain development activities, the programme will build the capacity of farmers and extension agents, and also pilot coffee value chain development with selected potential producers. Programme activities will contribute to strengthening women's empowerment and inclusion of women at all stages of implementation considering the social and cultural barriers rural women face in Yemen.

      "article_text": "Suzana Dimitrievska is an organic farmer in North Macedonia. She is using Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) to increase the efficiency of her family farm. ©Suzana Dimitrievska Suzana Dimitrievska is an organic farmer in North Macedonia. Coming from a line of strong, well-educated women, she has always been comfortable embracing new technology. She is using Information Communication Technologies (ICTs) to increase the efficiency of her family farm. Several years ago, she bought a farm management software that enabled her to better plan and monitor crops, minimize labour costs and spend less on gas and organic fertilizer, thereby raising her profits. After bagging a contract with a Swiss company in 2017, Suzana thought she could do all the work with seasonal labour. However, as the demand grew, she realized the need for and benefit of an automated solution that could control several different processes at the same time. Suzana, with support from a consultant and the Swiss company, was able to prepare a cost-benefit analysis of manual work versus using an automatic sorter. They identified an optical colour sorter machine that would be able to detect and sort over 123 different types of crops, herbs and agricultural products by their size, colour and form. “With a loan from the bank, she invested in the optical photo selector. Even though the price tag was hefty at 75 000 Euros, I am now able to easily select and pack beans at the same time meeting the quality standards of my customers,” says Suzana. Left: Suzana regularly shares her knowledge with other farmers. ©FAO/Sophie Treinen Right: Having purchased farm management software, Suzana is now able to plan and analyse crops from her office. ©Suzana Dimitrievska Information and Communication Technologies, like the ones chosen by Suzana, are long seen as drivers of rural development and are accelerating progress towards gender equality. ICTs refer to a broad category of devices and services that help famers gather, store, analyse and share data. They are empowering rural people, and especially women, in a myriad of ways – from cell phones that enable access to mobile banking and satellites that provide updated weather reports to drones that allow for detailed aerial imagery. However, those who could benefit the most from ICTs are also the ones least able to access and afford them. Poor rural women, despite playing a fundamental role in agricultural production, tend to have less access to ICTs than their wealthier, urban or male counterparts. As a result, in many rural areas, the full potential of ICTs remains untapped. Since adopting the farm management software, Suzana has enjoyed greater decision-making ability and seen her investment pay off. She is able to run her farm more efficiently, using the software to keep records, track costs, manage seasonal workers and analyse the profitability of each of her crops. In fact, after her first year using the software, Suzana learned that some of the crops she had cultivated for years were not economical – so she is now investigating more profitable options. Suzana is now looking into ICT-enabled precision agriculture as a way to reduce her risks and mitigate the effects of climate change. ©Suzana Dimitrievska Other ICTs could also be the key to Suzana’s future. In 2017, extraordinarily high temperatures took a heavy toll on Suzana’s crops. Her apricots, watermelons, beans, chickpeas and sunflowers were all affected, and the leaves of her grapes even burned in the heat. But by investing in precision agriculture – using ICTs like soil mapping and aerial imagery – she gained vital information about how and when to irrigate her crops for maximum efficiency. This approach will reduce the risk of losing crops and mitigate the effects of climate change. In the near future, she hopes to invest in additional modern irrigation system and soil sensors. “Smallholder farmers like myself still lack knowledge and understanding on the potential opportunities provided by ICTs,” says Suzana. “More demonstration farms are needed so that we can learn how new technologies can be used and what the benefits are, and eventually decide to invest in them.” FAO regularly organizes regional e-agriculture forums where the use of ICTs in food and agriculture are demonstrated and that give opportunities to smallholder farmers to share their own experiences with each other. FAO believes building smart, community-centred approaches to ICTs can provide rural people with the tools they need to innovate for change – and help grant more women farmers like Suzana, access to these key technologies. Moreover, as rural farmers take more active roles in their communities, ICTs can be effective tools for both women and men to alleviate poverty, advance gender equality and build a #ZeroHunger world.

      "article_text": "Access to land and natural resources can mean the difference between having food and going hungry. © FAO / Joan Manuel Baliellas Growing crops, fishing, harvesting fruits and nuts from the forests are just some examples of the activities that millions of people do daily to get food to eat or to earn a living. But when their rights to that land or those natural resources aren’t recognized, livelihoods and food sources can disappear from one day to the next. Rights to land, forests and fisheries can mean the difference between poverty and income, between going hungry and being satiated. These rights, also called tenure rights, can change people’s lives. Here’s how: 1. People can’t produce food without access to land and other natural resources. Tenure rights, i.e. rights to land or other natural resources, define who can use what resources for how long and under what conditions. When people have limited or insecure rights to land and other natural resources, they can’t produce the food they need to feed themselves or to earn an income. Helping people secure their rights to land and resources means helping ensure they are able to provide for themselves. 2. Tenure rights help to enforce women’s equality. In many countries, either because of custom or law, women do not have equal rights to land and other resources. Widows, for example, may lose the land they have been living or working on if laws prevent them from inheriting it from their husbands. Learn more"

Ending child labour means that millions of children regain the chance to stay in school, grow up happy and healthy and lead productive futures. © FAO / Cristiano Civitillo Many of us look back on our childhoods with warm feelings. But for more than 150 million girls and boys between the ages of 5 and 17 around the world, childhood means something else: poverty, a lack of education and working long hours in dangerous conditions. Child labour is defined as work that is inappropriate for a child’s age, or more specifically, work that affects a child’s education or is likely to harm their health, safety or morals. Around 70 percent of all child labourers work in agriculture (livestock, forestry, fishing or aquaculture) – that’s an increase of 12 percent, or 10 million more girls and boys, since 2012. Clearly, this is not an easy problem to erase, but it’s also an issue that we need to tackle to protect the well-being of millions of children. Children should be free to fully realize their rights to education, leisure and healthy development. This in turn provides the essential foundation for broader social and economic development, poverty eradication and human rights. But child labour is a complex problem. Some key factors that contribute to child labour in rural areas are low family incomes, too few livelihood alternatives, poor access to education and limited labour law enforcement. Many families and communities feel that they have no other choice than to employ their children in agriculture in order to keep up with their demands for food and income. In fact, an estimated two-thirds of agricultural child labourers work in family operations or alongside family members. Learn more"

      "article_text": "The digital revolution has changed the way we work, access information and connect with each other. It offers opportunities to those who can use the new technologies, but also presents new challenges for those who are left behind. Using technology to transform lives. (© FAO) Often referred to collectively as Information and Communications Technologies or ICTs, these technologies are any method of electronically sharing or storing data: telephones, mobile broadband, the internet, broadcasting, sensor networks, data storage and analytics, and more. ICTs improve the lives of small farmers in a myriad of ways, from monitoring crops to tracking market prices and from spreading good practices to facilitating access to banking services. The list goes on. Yet much of this potential remains untapped, particularly in the case of women, who play a fundamental role in agricultural production but also face a triple divide: digital, rural and gender. They often tend to have less access to ICTs, leaving them and their families at a disadvantage. Here are seven critical factors for success when making ICTs available and accessible to rural communities, especially women. 1. Adapt content so that it is meaningful for them. While ICTs can deliver large amounts of information, this does not imply effective use of it. Adaptation of content to local needs, languages and contexts often remains a challenge. Hence, content should be adapted to local languages and repackaged to suit formats that meet the different information needs. 2. Create a safe environment for them to share and learn. Illiteracy, and limited skills in using complex devices to search for information and cultural issues, remain barriers to effectively receiving and using information delivered via ICTs. For example, illiterate and older farmers often have less developed digital skills, and are therefore generally less likely to adopt ICTs. Learn more"

FAO takes women’s rights and gender issues very seriously. Why? International evidence and practice have proven that empowering rural women and girls is critical for agricultural development, for social and economic progress, and for sustainable development overall. Women form a significant proportion of the labour force in agriculture. FAO recognizes an important role and contribution from rural women in increasing food security and eradicating rural poverty through agricultural and rural development. Achieving a gender equality goal in itself is part of FAO commitment to women’s human rights as stated in international agreements, particularly the 1979 Convention on Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) signed by all FAO member governments in the region, and FAO’s own gender policy. The status of women in Europe and Central Asia is better than in other regions, right? While the countries are very diverse when it comes to gender equality, average indicators for Europe and Central Asia do point to higher educational status and higher economic activity rates. But if we break down available data not only by sex, but by location – for example, urban vs. rural – the disparities become evident. And in most of the countries, these disparities are not in rural women’s favour. They earn less, have fewer economic opportunities and as a result, are at greater risk of poverty. Learn more"

What would happen if this farmer just continued with their usual agricultural practices because they had no official rights to work on that land into the foreseeable future? As climate change becomes a harsh reality in many parts of the world, farmers need to adapt their farming techniques in order to survive.

      "article_text": "A simple and relatively inexpensive technology is revolutionizing the way West Africans smoke their fish. Women handle tasks related to fish smoking, shown here with traditional smoking ovens. (Image © FAO) In Côte d'Ivoire, as in much of West Africa, smoked fish plays a major role in the everyday diet. It is popular among locals not only for its taste and nutritional benefits, but also for its competitive pricing (especially compared to other protein options such as meat, milk and eggs) and its relatively long shelf-life (which ranges from 3–6 months). Smoked fish is also a vital source of income. An estimated 20–30 percent of Côte d'Ivoire’s marine and freshwater catch is consumed in smoked form, while fishing in general provides direct employment to 70 000 people and indirect employment to another 400 000, over 59 percent of whom are women. Indeed, in most coastal fishing communities, it is the women who are responsible for cleaning, drying, smoking and other tasks related to post-harvest processing, production and marketing of the fish. “The men in these communities are involved exclusively in the fishing,” explains Joseph Catanzano, a consultant from the FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Department. “Their workday is carried out primarily on the water, in their boats and along the beach, as they fish, bring in their catch, make adjustments to their boats and mend their nets. Their lives are lived outside in the strong sunlight, and in proximity to the sea.” According to the FAO flagship publication The State of World Fisheries and Aquaculture (2014), women make up as much as 90 percent of those working in secondary seafood activities such as fish processing. “That contrasts sharply with the women’s domain,” continues Mr Catanzano. “This is an area that is dark and poorly ventilated, used for the cleaning and post-harvesting work. This is the area where the smoking ovens are kept, and [it is] filled with thick smoke throughout the day as the women work to smoke the fish they will later sell in the markets.” The smoke from these ovens is one of the many problems posed by the traditional methods and techniques used in preparing smoked fish. “Traditional smoking releases contaminants known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), which are carcinogenic and hazardous to the human respiratory system,” says FAO Fishery Industry Officer Yvette Diei-Ouadi. This leads to respiratory, eye and other health problems, not only for the women but also for their children, who are often present while their mothers work at smoking the fish. The traditional ovens also require massive amounts of fuelwood or charcoal, which raises environmental concerns about deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions. “An exorbitant amount of CO2 is produced,” notes Ms Diei-Ouadi. “The kilns produce more greenhouse gas pollution than they should.” Traditional techniques also leave higher amounts of tar particles in the final product, affecting the taste and quality and therefore making it much more difficult to sell. Gender-sensitive by design In 2008, FAO began working with the National Training Centre for Fisheries and Aquaculture Technicians in Senegal (CNFTPA) to build on existing technologies in fish smoking, such as the popular Chorkor and the Banda ovens, and improve them further. The result of this collaboration was the FTT fish smoking technology (also known as Thiaroye or FTT-Thiaroye). The system, consisting of a dual-function oven and mechanical drier (which also acts as a storage unit), is specifically designed to help small-scale fish processors prepare and market safe, high-quality food. By design, the FTT-Thiaroye system is a gender-sensitive technique that can be used and maintained easily by women fish processors. By reducing drying and smoking times, and producing a product that sells more readily and rapidly, the new technology increases the time available to women for other pursuits, including caring for the household and children. A more marketable product also fetches premium prices, meaning increased income for the women who produce smoked and dried fish. Oumoul Khaïry Ndiaye, from FAO’s office in Burkina Faso, was among those who worked on the FTT design. “This is a system developed to address many aspects of fish smoking operations,\" she says. “In the first place stands the safety aspect — to secure consumers' health and meet international food standards. Then there's reducing post-harvest losses, and also curbing the drudgery of fish processors who are now less exposed to the heat and smoke.” Seeing the advantages Côte d'Ivoire is one of the many countries in which the FTT-Thiaroye has been introduced, and in which it has met with great success. In the village of Abobo Doumé, for example, two FTT prototypes were brought in to replace the more traditional fish-smoking systems, which used mud ovens and cut-up barrels. The new ovens were not only faster and more efficient; they greatly reduced the amount of smoke and heat to which the women were exposed, while also lowering the risk of burns. Moreover, because the FTT-Thiaroye reduces food loss and improves the overall quality of the final product, the women saw their incomes improve. “This new oven has radically transformed our working conditions, and consequently improved our livelihoods,” according to Micheline Dion Somplehi, one of the many women of Abobo Doumé who has benefited from the Thiaroye technology. In addition to being a fish processor, Ms Dion Somplehi is president of a cooperative comprising 1 650 women fish processors and fishmongers from the Côte d'Ivoire artisanal fisheries sector, and vice-president of the National Federation of Côte d'Ivoire Fishers’ Cooperatives (FENACOPECI). She is also in charge of the Women's Programme of the African Confederation of Artisanal Fisheries Professional Organisations (CAOPA), an apex platform which, since 2010, brings together organizations from 13 African countries. When Ms Dion Somplehi attended the Committee on Fisheries (COFI) at FAO in 2014, she was clear on the benefits that FTT had brought to her community. “We have seen the advantage of saving time in fish smoking,” she said. “And this is really important because in our communities, women are at the same time engaged in household chores – taking care of the children, working in the kitchen – while carrying out fish processing activities.” “We are even able to smoke [fish] in bad weather conditions,” she added. Indeed, another significant benefit of FTT-Thiaroye technology is that fish can be dried or smoked regardless of the weather. The more traditional methods, which involve drying the fish in the sun, can incur post-harvest losses of 10–50 percent, especially in the rainy season or in humid weather. Another advantage of the FTT system is its improved energy efficiency. The new kiln reduces charcoal consumption and optimizes the use of biomass: instead of just wood and charcoal, plant and organic byproducts such as coconut shells and husks, maize or millet cob, and cow dung can be used. In most countries, agriwaste is not only an affordable and environmentally-friendly alternative fuel, it is also easily available. As such, it can save women even more time and effort that would otherwise be expended in collecting or obtaining fuelwood. The FTT-Thiaroye has also been introduced with success in Ghana, Senegal, the United Republic of Tanzania, and Togo. In addition, many national fisheries institutions, authorities, and international development organizations, such as the World Bank in Togo and Côte d’Ivoire, are scaling up projects that involve FTT. And other countries in Africa and Asia, where fish smoking is common and where women are highly involved in fish processing, have also expressed interest in the technology. Meeting food safety standards Gaoussou Gueye, Secretary General of CAOPA, acknowledged the positive changes that Thiaroye technology had brought to women in the riparian communities of Lake Chad and Lake Volta. “Women fish processors have become more competitive at the regional and subregional markets, with smoked and dried fish products of much better quality,” he said, adding that the products were now able to “better meet food safety requirements.” This has indeed been the case for Côte d’Ivoire. Between 2006 and 2011, the European Union banned imports of processed fish from the country because of unacceptable PAH levels. The ban caused substantial economic losses, valued at around US$1.7 million per year. But with the introduction of the FTT-Thiaroye and its adoption by small-scale processors, Ivorian smoked products were able to meet the stringent market requirements for PAH levels. Cascaded training strategy Because the FTT-Thiaroye consists of components that have been designed to work with existing kilns, it is easy to upgrade traditional ovens to the FTT system. The equipment costs between US$500 and US$800, and can be built easily by metal workers using local materials. In the FTT programs that have involved FAO, at least 80 percent of the individuals trained to build, use, and maintain the FTT are women fish processors. Experience has shown that these women are more likely than their male counterparts to inform others of the positive results of this efficient new technique for fish processing. “What I have noticed so far is the efficiency of the cascaded training strategy,” said Mr Gueye. “That encourages women fish operators already benefiting from the use of FTT to provide training, in turn, to their peers.” For women like Ms Dion Somplehi, the advantages to this kind of approach are clear. “The FTT-Thiaroye ensures less heat, burn and smoke exposure,” she said. “We are now working under hygienic conditions.” See also: FAO Gender | New fish drying technology boosts livelihoods in Ivorian towns FAO Blue Growth Blog | Challenges to coastal fisheries communities in Abidjan, Côte d’Ivoire FAO Publications | Gender in Climate-Smart Agriculture: Module 18 for the Gender in Agriculture Sourcebook (Innovative Activity Profile 3 CSA for Fisheries: The Fao-Thiaroye Fish Processing Technique)"

      "article_text": "Nanama is one of around 10 000 street food vendors in the city of Accra, Ghana, most of whom are women. Indeed, the face of street food vending is female in much of Africa. “If a job earns you a living, it’s better than nothing.” With the exception of a few countries where cultural norms restrict their activities, women account for over 80 percent of street food vendors across the region. At the intersection of urban livelihoods and urban food systems A recent FAO study , conducted in collaboration with the University of Ghana’s School of Public Health, sheds new light on the street food trade in Accra’s metropolitan area, exploring the crucial role of women, as well as the sector’s overall importance and relevance to food and nutrition security in urban areas. Across sub-Saharan Africa, as in much of the developing world, street food trade and consumption has increased significantly in the last thirty years. Much of this is due to urbanization and the intertwined dynamics of expanding urban populations and urban sprawl. On the one hand, people commute greater distances for work, and the pace of both work and life in general has increased. This creates greater demand among a growing urban population for easy, quick and inexpensive meal options outside the house. On the other hand, as the urban population grows, more and more people struggle to find jobs in a wage-labour market that is not expanding as quickly. This is particularly problematic for certain groups (including women and other minorities), who often suffer from a lack of professional skills or resources. For these people, self-employment, often on an informal basis, becomes the only way to earn a living. And selling street food is one of their easiest and most viable options, as it requires no formal education and little start-up capital. The burgeoning street food sector therefore sits at the intersection of two key characteristics in expanding cities: the need to earn a living and the need for food. As a result, it is crucial to both livelihoods and food and nutrition security in growing urban centers like Accra. Moreover, and as the study confirmed, street food vendors tend to operate in areas that are especially relevant: in Accra, they were found to cluster in high-poverty areas, and almost half of all vendors were found to operate near schools, making them a central element in food and nutrition security for children and for the poor. Key findings The Ghana study found that on average, women account for over 90 percent of all street food vendors at country level. Most of them are between 25 and 45 years of age, and roughly three-fourths of them are married. Almost all of them rely on personal or family money to fund their enterprises, as bank loans and microfinance options are rarely taken into consideration. The study also revealed that contrary to common perceptions about the sector, the overall hygiene and food safety conditions under which street foods are prepared and sold in Accra are acceptable. This was linked to rising levels of education among the vendors, as well as to training sessions that have been conducted in recent years by local authorities in collaboration with FAO. These sessions have improved vendor knowledge and practices in hygiene and safety standards, as well as food handling and storage. The female faces of street food vending In addition to the study, a new video , produced by FAO in collaboration with the University of Ghana, profiles a handful of these women, illustrating the diversity of their individual experiences while also underscoring a common thread of determination, hard work, and resilience in the face of so many challenges. Comfort is a typical example. Although she has a university degree, she was unable to find a job. So she attended cooking classes and soon set to work developing an eye-catching brand and logo for her new business. At twenty-seven years old, she is relatively new to the world of street food. But thanks to a savvy entrepreneurial spirit and a passion for her work, she is off to a good start. “Comfort Dede Amoah is my name but Cadota is my brand name,” she says as she points proudly to the sign above her kiosk. I chose to sell food because it is my passion. What makes me happy is cooking and baking cakes and decorating them. — Comfort Comfort’s day begins at five in the morning, when she wakes and goes to the local market to buy her ingredients. She opens her street food kiosk at eight o’clock, and from then until sunset she sells traditional Ghanaian specialties such as jollof rice, ampesie, palava sauce, fried chicken, banku with tilapia fish, and pastries, which are her true passion. Though Comfort has only recently begun, most of the women interviewed in the FAO study have been in the street food industry for an average of eight years, indicating that the sector is not merely a temporary source of income, and can in fact be seen as a longstanding employment option. Indeed, for many of them, like Mary, vending is the only job they’ve ever had. I’ve done this job since I was a child. I can’t imagine doing anything else, apart from selling food. My clients are satisfied because I cook well, and I am happy. — Mary And while the study found that most women vendors are between 25 and 45 years old, there are many exceptions, such as Adwoa, who is still going strong in her seventies. I am 74 years old. I sell rice, waakye, and I just added banku to my menu. I really like selling waakye. — Adwoa The study revealed that street food vendors work an average of ten hours a day, six days a week, though this does not include time spent on buying and cooking ingredients, which means that in reality their days are often even longer. I wake up around 3 a.m. I prepare my ingredients and tools, and I start cooking. Then I clean the place. — Edith I come here [at] 6:30 a.m. and I close at 11:30 in the evening. It’s normal for me; not too hard. — Cynthia And while the study noted that the overall standards of hygiene and food safety among the vendors were found to be acceptable, the women themselves can face a range of risks and health hazards. Fire heat is a major concern. There is a limit to how long you can endure the heat, before it becomes dangerous for your health. — Nanama Even with the long hours and difficult days, however, many vendors still struggle to run their business. Now that plantain is out of season, I have to borrow money to buy supplies. But it’s not always enough. — Mary They are often unable to save money or obtain access to loans, making it harder to expand their business or plan for the future. As a widow, I pray to God, to make my job profitable enough, so that I can buy a piece of land, and build a house for my children. — Charlotte One of my challenges is the lack of capital. I need help to invest. — Joyce I hope for a better future. There is no pension fund in this job, so I have to save up for a rainy day. — Essi But despite the hard work and uncertainty, many vendors see street food as their best option. Food vending is a very good business. It’s better than working for someone else for a meagre salary. At least I can feed my children. — Adam Indeed, for the women in the video, and for others in Accra and elsewhere in the developing world, street food vending offers a way to start and run a business with small amounts of capital, traditional cooking skills, and whatever cooking equipment they have on hand. I like to use money to do more things in my life. I have big aspirations. — Cynthia See also: FAO Video | A Woman’s Business: Street Food Stories from Accra FAO Gender | FAO survey on street food vendors in Accra finds women play a central role FAO In Action | Supporting women entrepreneurs in providing nutrition and food safety in Ghana"

      "article_text": "“It’s time for us indigenous women to break our silence. It’s time for us to speak up.” © FAO Elsie Mokudef is an indigenous woman farmer from the province of Maguindanao, in the Philippines. She is one of more than 150 indigenous women from around the world who have so far attended the Global Leadership School for Indigenous Women, a special capacity building programme spearheaded by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the International Indigenous Women’s Forum (IIWF, also known as the Foro Internacional de Mujeres Indigenes, or FIMI). Launched in May 2015 and implemented so far in Bolivia, Peru, India, the Philippines, Panama and Paraguay, the programme seeks to empower indigenous women leaders and activists to advocate for human rights, food security and nutrition. Crucial role of indigenous peoples – and women in particular Given the wealth of their ancestral and traditional knowledge, the complexity of their food systems and the resilience of their agricultural practices in the face of climate change, indigenous peoples have a crucial role to play in addressing the problems of hunger, food insecurity and sustainable development at large. Despite their importance, however, they are among the most marginalized and disadvantaged groups in the world. For example, indigenous peoples account for 5 percent of the world’s population, yet they comprise about 15 percent of the world’s poor. Much of this vulnerability and marginalization stems from the violation of their rights, especially with regard to land and resources. Indigenous women, in particular, often struggle not only with poverty and with the many challenges arising from their indigenous status, but also with gender-based discrimination that affects all spheres of their lives, exacerbating the inequalities they face both within and beyond their communities. For example, they are frequently prevented from participating in political activities and decision-making processes. “We see in communities that only a few women are given the opportunity to participate in decision-making and this is usually because they are insecure about speaking.” — Elsie Mokudef (Teduray), Maguindanao, the Philippines In comparison with their male counterparts, indigenous women often have less access to education and training, which in turn makes access to decision-making spaces even more of a challenge. This limits the contributions they can make at both household and community level, especially with regard to issues of prime importance for indigenous peoples, such as food security, seed preservation, and biodiversity conservation. “Women are the main providers of food in the household not only in terms of preparing it but also in sowing, planting and harvesting it. But it is still the men who decide what food or crop should be planted and harvested, what should be bought and sold in the market.” — Darhmingliani Hloncheu (Khasi and Mizo), Meghalaya, India In addition to being the main producers of food for the family, indigenous women typically also act as custodians of seeds and stewards of biodiversity conservation. Their involvement in decision-making is therefore critical. “When we talk about women and food security we need to realize that women are vital [to] the production of food. It is us who produce, who prepare the food and feed our families.” — Judith Paucar, Puno, Peru Global Leadership School for Indigenous Women In 2014, FAO began working with FIMI to address these and other issues through the Global Leadership School for Indigenous Women. The School, which is targeted to women leaders and human rights activists from indigenous groups, focuses on advocacy, human rights, food security and nutrition. “Indigenous women need this kind of school because most of us do not know about our rights; we know there are rights but we do not know how to implement them and we do not know how to advocate for them.” — Darhmingliani Hloncheu (Khasi and Mizo), Meghalaya, India While each school is unique in its adaptation to country needs, the overall structure is defined in three phases. The first phase involves a week of intensive, in-person, group training in the capital city of each country. This includes workshops, discussions and presentations on a range of topics related to advocacy, human rights, food security and nutrition, as well as sessions on communications, leadership, networking, planning and strategy. “This is the first time that I am able to join a gathering of indigenous women from different parts of the country and even from outside our country. We can see a democratic dialogue and we are learning through sharing our experiences and listening to the experiences of others.” — Elsie Mokudef (Teduray), Maguindanao, the Philippines Country-specific issues affecting indigenous peoples—and women in particular—are discussed, and representatives from country-specific institutions, including government authorities, civil society, academia and other relevant sectors are invited to join in on sessions and participate in promoting dialogue. “The information was local, national and international, that is why I could learn how to develop advocacy processes with different authorities, being able to apply this knowledge to the organization I belong to.” — Vanesa Viera, Pando, Bolivia The second phase, which lasts five months, is conducted via an e-learning / online platform. Participants read relevant documentation and share reflections, analysis and ideas via a web-based discussion forum. The process is supported by facilitators from FIMI as well as by FAO technical experts, and special guests are invited to address specific subjects. During this phase, each participant selects an issue of particular priority and relevance and, with guidance and feedback, develops a full advocacy plan to address and effect change in the chosen area or issue. “My advocacy plan is based in food sovereignty. We want the wheat from my region to be produced and processed to make cookies for school breakfasts, as a way to promote healthy and nutritious consumption of our local products.” — Clementina Garnica, Potosí, Bolivia The advocacy plans have focused on a range of goals, from increasing access to education and health services and improving food systems and food security, to enhancing women’s roles and recognition in community decision-making. “The idea is to manage the administration, the mayor’s office and the University of Pando to support capacity-building processes in order to avoid youth migration. In addition, this plan gives youth the opportunity to become service providers and technical assistants in the communities.” — Vanesa Viera, Pando, Bolivia A third and final phase features sessions on topics of interest to each group, along with presentations of the participants’ finished advocacy plans. Many of the plans developed so far reflect an extraordinary amount of effort and innovation, and have resulted in mini-project proposals. FAO and FIMI are currently exploring funding possibilities for supporting implementation of the best of these at national or community level. Stories of positive change and progress On completing the programme, participants are encouraged to replicate training activities in their communities, raising awareness and strengthening support for other indigenous women. “I feel strengthened and informed because now I know the laws and I feel we are supported to be able to make efficient advocacy in our municipalities and with our authorities.” — Bernardina Laura, La Paz, Bolivia In this context, many of the School’s “graduates” have reported back with stories of positive change and progress in their communities. These have included the creation of women’s groups, the organization of community discussions and seminars on laws and policies, collaboration with local non-governmental organizations on land claims, demonstrations of agricultural techniques that revive traditional ways of farming, and awareness-raising on traditional seed preservation. “Coming here, participating in this school, I feel that I have learnt so many things that I can take back to the community, to the women I work with.” — Darhmingliani Hloncheu (Khasi and Mizo), Meghalaya, India See also: FAO | Indigenous Peoples: Empowering indigenous women in Bolivia, Peru, India and the Philippines FAO | Gender: Indigenous women represent Philippines in global leadership school FAO | Gender: Escuela de Liderazgo de Mujeres Indígenas [in Spanish] Flickr | FAO of the UN: Leadership School of Indigenous Women in the Philippines"

Herlinda is one of many women who have made positive changes in their lives through the United Nations joint programme on Accelerating Progress towards the Economic Empowerment of Rural Women (RWEE). In telling her story, Herlinda recalls how things were before the RWEE programme came to Panzós, when women were excluded from many of the decision-making processes of the community, and did not participate in training and other activities. Indeed, she remembers being unsure of how much she could do. “When I came to the women’s group and committed myself to work and participate in the training processes of the programme, I felt very afraid and wondered, would I be capable to cope with this commitment?” Accelerating Progress towards the Economic Empowerment of Rural Women (RWEE) is a joint programme of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ), the International Fund for Agriculture Development ( IFAD ), the United Nations World Food Programme ( WFP ), and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women ( UN Women ). Launched in October 2012 and currently funded by the governments of Sweden and Norway, the five-year multi-agency programme is being implemented in Ethiopia, Guatemala, Kyrgyzstan, Liberia, Nepal, Niger and Rwanda, where it aims to empower rural women, in particular by improving their food and nutrition security, increasing their incomes, enhancing their decision-making power and encouraging policy environments that are conducive to their economic empowerment. “Now I know what rights we have as women...” Through the initiatives supported by the RWEE programme, the women of Panzós have begun to participate and have a greater voice in community activities and decision-making. Herlinda herself is now confident of the active role she plays as president of the Women’s Committee; she coordinates training and other activities that support 25 women. “Now I know what rights we have as women, and that we have the right to participate in the different committees established in our community; we must strive to be the leaders of our organization.” At home, the women have begun to apply the skills and techniques they have learned from RWEE training sessions on improved food security and farming methods. For example, Herlinda now knows how to better manage any surplus production in her corn crop, including through grain storage, reserves and planning for seasonal shortages and price increases. Improvements “Now, because of my participation and the [RWEE programme's] support to women, we are improving our family life. With the money I made from selling my corn in town, I made improvements to my house — I installed corrugated steel sheets and have more space to live with my sons and daughters-in-law.” “In the beginning, my husband, Tomás, used to tell me, ‘Herlinda, why did you commit yourself to this?’ But now that he has realized that I am contributing money resulting from selling the product of my effort, he says, ‘You really had a good reason for wanting to be in this project.’”"

      "article_text": "Chandra Kala Thapa is a thirty-year-old smallholder farmer living in Ranichauri, a village in the Sindhuli District of south-eastern Nepal. Like many women farmers here and in other parts of the developing world, she has faced a number of barriers to impr Many of these barriers are related to cultural norms that limit women’s access to productive resources, such as land and agricultural inputs. In many cases, they do not own any land themselves, and instead work on family farms that are owned and managed by husbands or male relatives. Because of this, women reap few of the financial benefits of their labour. Even if women do own or control land, however small in plot size, the burden of household chores—which in most homes is placed solely on women—greatly limits the time they have to work on their land. And many families are reluctant to let women go to market to buy seeds or fertilizers, further limiting their mobility and productivity. Chandra, for example, owns no land. Yet she is responsible for tending her family farm for little or no profit, and works for around 16 hours a day. She also engages in a great deal of unpaid work at home, such as cooking, cleaning, and childcare, all of which is both physically demanding and time-consuming. In early 2016, the United Nations joint programme on Accelerating Progress towards the Economic Empowerment of Rural Women (RWEE) began working with Chandra and other smallholder women farmers in Ranichauri and elsewhere in Nepal, to help them improve their agricultural productivity and food and nutrition security, while also increasing their income. Accelerating Progress towards the Economic Empowerment of Rural Women (RWEE) is a joint programme of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations ( FAO ), the International Fund for Agriculture Development ( IFAD ), the United Nations World Food Programme ( WFP ), and the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women ( UN Women ). Launched in October 2012 and currently funded by the governments of Sweden and Norway, the five-year multi-agency programme is being implemented in Ethiopia, Guatemala, Kyrgyzstan, Liberia, Nepal, Niger and Rwanda, where it aims to empower rural women, in particular by improving their food and nutrition security, increasing their incomes, enhancing their decision-making power and encouraging policy environments that are conducive to their economic empowerment. “Now the money comes on time” With the support and training they received from RWEE, the women have been quick to increase their yields and market their surplus, and Chandra was no exception. “The RWEE JP provided me with technical knowledge as well as agriculture inputs (seeds, fertilizers, equipment) and facilitated access to credit so that I could produce more crops and sell [them] in the market,” she explains. They have also learned to reap the benefits of crop diversification. Chandra points out that a kilogram of maize would sell for 40 Nepalese rupees in the market, whereas the fruits and vegetables that she can grow and sell throughout the year bring in up to 120 Nepalese rupees per kilogram. The steady market for their produce helps to ensure a consistent and sustainable source of income. “Now the prices are good and the money comes on time. This was not the case when I used to sell maize in the market,” she adds, as she picks broad beans in the kitchen garden she has set up outside her house. United in their shared goal A key aspect of RWEE’s work involves strengthening local farmers’ organizations. Chandra, who is the president of the Laliguras Women Farmers’ Group, meets with her fellow women farmers at least once every two weeks to discuss issues and find solutions to a wide range of problems, both farm- and family-related. She feels strongly that working together as part of a farmers’ association has been a significant morale booster for the women, as they are now united in their shared goal to grow enough nutritious food for their families and for their livelihoods. Chandra is happy that her sons, aged eight 8 and 11, are getting a balanced diet at home and that she can afford to send them to school. “Before, I had no money to properly feed my children or send them to school. Now, I produce enough for me and my family. I am happy that I can provide for their education and also pay for medical care,” she says. She also recognizes other tangible benefits of the RWEE. “This training has boosted my confidence and given me an opportunity to express myself. It has also equipped me with knowledge to advance my rights. These days I can participate more fully in activities both related to my home and community,” she says. The programme focused in particular on garnering and solidifying support from the men in the community, especially in addressing many of the barriers the women faced in increasing their productivity and income. Indeed, Chandra notes that the support she received from her husband, Bir Bahadur Thapa, has been instrumental to her success. “I often share my learnings about gender with my husband,” she says, adding with a smile, “I am so happy that he is helping me both in my household chores and in farms.” See also: Joint Programme RWEE Video: Changing the lives of rural women in Nepal"

      "article_text": "Idrissa and his wife Ramatou live in the village of Tinkirana, in the Tahoua region of Niger. Like most of the men and women of their community and others across sub-Saharan Africa, they struggle with the effects of climate change on a daily basis. In recent years, a combination of declining average rainfall and increasing land degradation has meant that many in Tinkirana and much of rural Niger have suffered from a series of poor harvests and severe food shortages. Idrissa’s farmland too, was severely degraded. Last year, he harvested only 150 bales of millet. But this year has been different for Idrissa and Ramatou, thanks to the collective will and work of their fellow villagers, and the catalytic effect of the FAO Dimitra Clubs. The FAO-Dimitra programme centres on a highly successful gender-transformative approach developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Dimitra Clubs are made up of groups of rural women and men equipped with solar and crank radios and mobile phones. They meet regularly to discuss the challenges they face in their daily lives, make decisions together and take collective action to solve community problems with local resources. Success stories are then broadcast on local radio stations in order to inspire other Dimitra Clubs. Since 2006, 1500 Dimitra Clubs have been set up in Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, the Niger and Senegal. The Dimitra Clubs of Tinkirana began as part of a larger FAO initiative to improve community resilience to climate change and increase agricultural production in the area. Through a mix of brainstorming sessions, dialogues and discussions within the clubs, the villagers — both men and women — were able to come to a better shared understanding of the food deficit they faced, its underlying causes, and ways to address it. As a result, they decided on a series of adaptation strategies. These included growing off-season crops and setting up mini cereal banks, both of which can help ensure food availability during lean periods. Confronting the problems of climate change In particular, the members of Tinkirana’s Dimitra Clubs confronted the problems of declining rainfall and soil degradation. Recognizing that land rehabilitation techniques are key to fighting degradation and increasing the amount of land available for agriculture, they mobilized members of the community to work together on a ‘trial’ or pilot project. They knew that if the experiment turned out to be a success, it would not only serve as a proof of concept for the rest of the village, but also increase community awareness on land rehabilitation techniques and their benefits. Together, they selected an area of degraded land on the outskirts of the village, and worked collectively to dig and prepare the land, creating a series of demi-lunes or half-moons in the earth. This water-harvesting technique uses semicircular earth embankments to collect and store rainwater and prevent runoff, providing a simple but innovative way to rehabilitate degraded land and improve crop production in areas with low average rainfall. The land chosen by the members of the Dimitra Clubs was Idrissa’s. And thanks to the success of the ‘trial,’ Idrissa’s millet harvest went from 150 bales to 800 — without the use of any chemical or organic fertilizers. Results of the experiment Idrissa and Ramatou were not the only ones to reap the benefits of the collective land rehabilitation experiment. As is common for rural women in many parts of the world, the women of Tinkirana have very little access to land, and many of the village women had been asking for plots on which to cultivate their crops. When the village chief saw the results of the trial, he granted the women a large plot of land at the edge of the village. Being degraded land, it had never been farmed before. But the women divided it up amongst themselves and, with the support of the whole village, soon put it to good use. Today, the results of the experiment are clear: the women of Tinkirana have permanent access to land, and the community of Tinkirana, as a whole, has improved its agricultural production and food security — sustainably."

As Nelka puts it, “I don’t need to look far for help because the other farmers in the groundnut field assist me, especially during harvesting.” In developing their labour-sharing approach, the farmers also identified roles that were best suited to each member, and this has led to a fairer and more equal distribution of responsibility among the men and women in the group.",
      "article_text": "“I am confident that this groundnut cultivation will help educate my children and earn a substantial income for my family” says Nelka Kumari Ariyasena. © FAO / Mahina Bongso The promotion of OFC cultivation, which is part of the “European Union – Support to District Development Programme” (EU-SDDP), aims to increase income generation and improve livelihoods among Sri Lankan farmers, and focuses on gender involvement, shared roles, and sustainability. Farmers like Nelka and her fellow group members are already seeing results. “Through the income I earned this time from selling the groundnut seeds I was able to buy a bicycle,” says Nelka. Indeed, after just three months of cultivation and 133 000 Sri Lanka rupees in expenditures, the group made a net profit of 920 000 Sri Lanka rupees. Deepa Priyadarshani, another member of the group, credits their success to the extensive training and continued support from the project. “We were given guidance and the agriculture officers and FAO officers constantly inspected our cultivations,” she explains. Inputs such as seeds were also crucial — “the Department of Agriculture through the intervention of FAO provided us with good quality seeds, which we cultivated in November last year.” The \"European Union – Support to District Development Programme\" (EU-SDDP) aims to reduce poverty and improve sustainable livelihoods among Sri Lanka’s most vulnerable populations, particularly women, people with special needs, and conflict-affected communities.

In addition to ensuring quality seeds, guidance, and frequent field inspections, FAO also registered the group with the Seed Certification Service Center of the Department of Agriculture. Membership with the Center allows them to have a better price for their groundnut seeds, as well as a reliable partner for quality processing and production of their crops at a commercial level. A group effort Another key feature of the group’s efficiency and success lies in the benefits of collective participation. From the beginning, the women showed a strong preference for working in a group rather than individually, and this has had a positive impact on many aspects of the initiative, including training, extension services, knowledge sharing and capacity building. Perhaps most importantly, this collective, shared approach to labour has lightened the load for each individual farmer, and contributed to the group’s overall efficiency and sustainability. As Nelka puts it, “I don’t need to look far for help because the other farmers in the groundnut field assist me, especially during harvesting.” In developing their labour-sharing approach, the farmers also identified roles that were best suited to each member, and this has led to a fairer and more equal distribution of responsibility among the men and women in the group. As a result, the women have more time for household chores and for engaging in commercial-scale production, while the men have time to attend to their paddy cultivations. And overall, there is a sense of reciprocity and teamwork. “My husband supports me by encouraging me to work in the groundnut cultivation and also by helping me in the farming activities,” says Chandrika Kumari Ranasinghe, another member of the group. Speaking up for the men, 65-year-old H.M. Ariyaratne agrees: “We can depend on each other,” he says. “If I fall ill and I am unable to work in the field, somebody from the group will tend to my plot of groundnut production.” “There is unity within the group and that is our main strength.”"

Across a variety of sectors, from smallholder farmers to pastoralists and from forest keepers to fishers, men and women usually have very different—though complementary—roles, with © FAO / Daniel Hayduk However, in most developing countries, women work longer hours than men when both paid and unpaid work is taken into consideration. Much of this work—which reflects rural women’s triple work burden in the productive, reproductive and social spheres—consists of laborious and repetitive domestic tasks that are less visible, unpaid, and severely restrictive of their time and mobility. The fact that rural women spend more time in order to produce less has broad implications for the food and nutrition security, prosperity, health and well-being of themselves, their families and their communities. Two recent publications from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) provide a comprehensive overview of the causes, implications and constraints related to rural women’s time poverty in agriculture, while also reviewing solutions that can help empower and enable them to reduce their work burden and free up time and energy for activities of greater value: Running out of time: the reduction of women's work burden in agricultural production Addressing women’s work burden: key issues, promising solutions and way forward Positive impact for agricultural production The two publications draw on a wealth of research to make a compelling case for addressing women’s time poverty and work burden, not only with respect to the potential for positive impact in agricultural production, but also for the benefits foreseen in many other spheres. Indeed, when their work burden is reduced, women use the freed time in a variety of ways, including additional care work (of children, the elderly, and the sick); wage labour and entrepreneurship (for increased household income); awareness raising, community mobilization and social activities; education; and leisure. In Viet Nam, for instance, when time spent on hand weeding was reduced, more time was allocated to child care, income-generating and community activities. Both publications identify specific practices, technologies and services that have proven successful in reducing women’s work burden and/or time poverty. These include agricultural systems or techniques such as aquaponics, conservation agriculture, kitchen and keyhole gardens, and rice-fish farming; as well as equipment, technologies or tools such as weeders, water wheels and mobile water tanks. Aquaponics in Gaza Aquaponics is a sustainable food production system that combines aquaculture (farming fish) and hydroponics (growing plants without soil) in an integrated, symbiotic environment. It is particularly useful for families with limited land and water, as food can be produced on rooftops or in backyards. In Gaza, where access to good agricultural land and water are a chronic issue, and where women often face additional constraints on their mobility, an FAO project provided 100 vulnerable, female-headed households with aquaponics systems for rooftop or backyard gardens, thereby enabling the women to produce food for their families at home. Thanks to the project, women like Eman Nofal were able to grow cucumbers, eggplants, hot peppers, rocket and tomatoes. And like others, Eman found aquaponics easy to use. “The system doesn’t require much effort to manage,” she said. In fact, it was simple enough that even her children learned to use it, planting and harvesting the vegetables and raising the fish. “I ask my kids to help me with the system because I want them to understand that if they plant, they will be able to harvest and enjoy fresh vegetables.” But despite these success cases, the adoption rate for innovative time- and labour-saving agricultural technologies and services remains low. This is because women face a variety of barriers and constraints in their access to and adoption of solutions, many of which are context-specific and complex. Sometimes a tool is inappropriate – and sometimes it gets appropriated... Social norms, for example, can often inhibit women’s access to and adoption of certain technologies, tools, and services. In many parts of West Africa, it is considered inappropriate for women to use long-handled hoes. And among some ethnic groups in Burkina Faso, women are prohibited from riding bicycles. Social norms may also affect other, more general restrictions on mobility and on associating with non-family members – all of which can pose barriers to women’s adoption of new technologies or services. Household dynamics may also play a role. Men tend to manage other family members’ use of technology and tools, and often appropriate them for their own use – either because they attribute social importance to their use, or because they see income-generating potential. For example, a project in South Africa provided women with donkey carts to help them with fuelwood collection, but the move backfired, because their husbands appropriated the carts to collect and sell wood found closer to home – forcing the women to travel even farther than before to find wood. On the other hand, a project to improve communication among rural Cambodian women was able to address this kind of problem head-on: they distributed pink cell phones to the women, thereby making the phones less attractive to men and ensuring that the phones would remain in the hands of the women. A gender-sensitive approach is therefore crucial to understanding the different barriers and constraints that women face. It also helps to ensure that interventions do not inadvertently increase women’s time poverty or work burden, or result in other negative consequences, whether direct or indirect. This was illustrated by a project in Zambia, where women are in charge of processing maize: when an “improved” hybrid variety was introduced, it effectively increased their work burden, because it required more time and effort to pound than the variety grown previously. In a similar vein, participatory consultation can prove instrumental in ensuring context-specific, culturally responsive approaches. In the Syrian Arab Republic, for example, prior consultations with women established that they were not in favour of mechanizing the lentil harvesting process, as they feared they would lose their income-generating jobs to men. Indeed, in some settings, women may in fact appreciate or even prefer to continue performing certain chores. The custom of collecting water at a river, for example, may offer a valuable opportunity for social time and for information exchange with peers. The publications are available for download via the following links: This background paper provides a comprehensive overview of rural women’s time poverty in agriculture, discussing possible causes and implications, exploring solutions, and noting the kinds of constraints that rural women often face in accessing and adopting such solutions for reducing their work burden. This factsheet captures key messages from the background paper, highlighting successful time- and labour-saving solutions and discussing specific challenges that rural women face in access and adoption. It also catalogues the complementary approaches of FAO, IFAD and UNIDO in addressing rural women’s work burden and time poverty, including priority areas of work, initiatives, and resources."

      "article_text": "Since 2006, Dimitra Clubs have played a crucial role in strengthening rural communities in sub-Saharan Africa, with a special focus on women’s empowerment. A new video, produced by Esprit Libre and FAO-Dimitra, takes a look at how these clubs enable rural women to step up and realize their potential. From good practices in crop farming and post-harvest processing to medical care for their communities, the video “ FAO-Dimitra Clubs: Women Leaders ” illustrates how rural women are forging paths towards greater food security, nutrition, health and better livelihoods, not only for themselves but for those around them. The FAO-Dimitra Project centres on a highly successful gender-transformative approach developed by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). FAO-Dimitra Clubs are made up of groups of rural women and men who decide to meet regularly to discuss the challenges they face in their daily lives, make decisions together and take collective action to solve community problems with their own means. Since 2006, 1500 FAO-Dimitra Clubs have been set up in Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ghana, the Niger and Senegal. “I work like men” Among the women featured in the video, Marguerite Atilomoi, a woman farmer from the Democratic Republic of the Congo, is a typical example. Marguerite, who goes by her nickname ‘Maguy,’ is the moderator of a Dimitra Club in the village of Yanonge, some 60 km from Kisangani, in the country’s northeastern Tshopo province. As one of the first women to get involved in the clubs’ approach, Maguy also supports the activities of around 15 other clubs in her area, visiting them weekly to give advice and help members move forward. In addition, she is both president of the local agricultural producer organization and vice-president of the Union of Producer Organizations of Yanonge. All this is a long way from where – and how – this determined young woman started out. “I was born in Lokomba, five km from central Yanonge. That is where I spent my childhood. After completing the fifth year of secondary school at the Agricultural Technical Institute of Yanonge, I abandoned my studies to go and live with my boyfriend, who later became my hus­band. Very soon, I was expecting my first child, in 2008. Also very soon, I realized that I had made a mistake in abandoning my studies and I began asking my husband to help me finish my secondary education. Since he refused to pay my school fees, and was against me taking up my studies again, I left him for a while and returned to my family home, with the bless­ing of my parents and encouraged by my older brother. I obtained my state diploma at the end of the school year 2010–2011 and went on to become an agriculture instructor. In the end, I went back to my husband and today I am the mother of two children.” Maguy is also, of course, a farmer. She makes a living by farming groundnuts, palm nuts, and a local vegetable called niébé (a kind of cowpea). This is a demanding activity, but she still finds time to continue learning. “I’m taking courses at an agricultural technical school,” she says proudly. “I am an agronomist, I work like men. So I have made up the term ‘agrowoman.’ In my field I respect the spacing and the specific crop conditions. This makes the difference between my field and most of the others.” Maguy knows there are still challenges to face. “My major concern is that society should acknowledge the contribu­tion made by women to the daily life of house­holds and communities. When I talk about society, I mean men, but also women them­selves, who underestimate their knowledge and their power.” But she feels strongly about the good work done through the Dimitra Clubs. “The listeners’ clubs take action and don’t make empty promises,” she says. “I have been able to motivate everyone” Not far to the west, in the village of Itenge, Myriam Bogadi would surely agree. “I am not paid,” says Myriam of her work as moderator of a Dimitra Club. “But I am learning so many other things thanks to the experiences that are shared in the clubs. It helps me to move forward in my life.” At first, Myriam simply participated in the Dimitra Club meetings, discussing the problems of the village, working to find solutions, and joining in on collective action as did other members. But over time, she became more involved in mobilizing her community, and everyone recognized her potential. She quickly became moderator of the club. “Since I have been a moderator, we have restored the club’s meeting place,” she says, adding confidently that “I have been able to motivate everyone.” Myriam is particularly proud of her idea to support the village health centre. Built in 2003, the original health centre was in such a crumbling state that it had to shut down. But through the efforts of the Dimitra Club, it has since been reopened. A nurse has been appointed, and the club members contribute to its medicine supply. As a result, sick people and pregnant women no longer have to endure long walks or spend hours on the back of a bicycle to reach the nearest hospital. Words into action The video also takes us to rural Niger, where Dimitra clubs have been operating since 2009. We meet Souweyba Idé, from the village of Gasseda, in the country’s southwest. As a club moderator, Souweyba was able to realize her potential and play a key role in her community: she was at the forefront of an important proposal developed through the clubs — a proposal that was convincing enough to win the village a multifunctional platform from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP). A multifunctional platform, or MFP, consists of a chassis onto which a simple, robust motor is mounted. This is fitted with a generator that supplies mechanical and electrical energy to various pieces of equipment, such as a huller, grain mill and battery charger. The platform can power other tools, such as a grinder or a welding unit, and it can provide enough energy to power the electrical network of a village. Back in 2011, when the FAO-Dimitra team visited Gasseda, the women spoke of their difficulties in translating words into action. But as Souweyba explains, much has changed. “Thanks to the clubs, we can introduce ourselves as a structured group, and because of this we were shortlisted and granted the platform. We have learned to think about what we want – to defend our ideas and convince our partners.” “Before the Dimitra Clubs were created, I wasn’t aware of my own ability to structure my thoughts and talk,” says Djamila Hassane, who moderates another of Gasseda’s Dimitra Clubs. “I didn’t have the self-confidence to sit with my husband and raise issues that are important to me. But now I often share with him knowledge acquired in the club.” Hamsa Makido, who is treasurer to the management committee for the multifunctional platform, agreed that it was “thanks to the listeners’ club that we were able to get this machine. The listeners’ club changed us, and it is because they [UNDP project staff] saw that we were motivated that they gave us the machine.” “Now we are no longer ashamed” Today, Gasseda’s platform is used to peel, grind and crush the villagers’ grain mechanically, as well as to provide electricity for the community. Its impact has been particularly important for the women, as the huller and grain mill save them a significant amount of time and labour. This extra time was soon put to good use, however. The women managed to obtain land in the village of Gourou, which they then set up for vegetable gardening. Each day some of the women travel the two kilometers to Gourou to water and care for the land; the vegetables they grow are consumed at home or sold for income. Even the youngest girls benefit from the new platform – now that they no longer have to pound millet, they have more time for their education. “Before the machine arrived, our hands had calluses. Now they are smooth. Before, we never had time to do anything else. Now, we practise horticulture, and I leave each morning to water my plants. Now, all the women practise horticulture. Before, we used to spend all our time preparing meals,” said Sofi Sidikou, one of the women in charge of the platform. “The machine has greatly improved our lives and now we are no longer ashamed to show our hands when we speak,” she added, laughing.

      "article_text": "Across the developing world, rural women play a crucial role in agriculture and farming. And Bangladesh, where women exceed 50 percent of the agricultural labour force, is no exception. Eliza Khan, a dairy farmer from the Sirajganj district of Rajshahi in central Bangladesh, is a beneficiary of an FAO project focusing on smallholder dairy development. So it’s no surprise that much of FAO’s work in the country has focused on supporting rural women farmers across a variety of sectors. These include aquaculture, crop, and dairy farming, all of which are showcased in a recent FAO video, Women Farmers of Bangladesh . “If I hadn’t received this training...” Shipra Bagchi is the first of the women we meet in the video; she is a shrimp farmer from the village of Baniakhali in Bagerhat, a district of the Khulna division in southwestern Bangladesh. When she first started shrimp farming twenty years ago, Shipra had less than a tenth of a hectare of land (0.05 ha). She recalls how difficult it was to make ends meet in those days. “At that time, this whole area was inundated. Rice cultivation wasn’t possible.” She remembers that people used to survive by picking water lilies. And Shipra herself struggled with her new endeavour. “Earlier, I didn’t know the good practices of shrimp farming.” Thanks to a project implemented by FAO and the Ministry of Fisheries and Livestock, with support from the Standards and Trade Development Facility (STDF), Shipra received training in key skills and techniques for improved and increased shrimp production: “How to enhance shrimp production, the benefit of the nursery and the use of PCR certified seeds, correct doses of lime, etc.” “If I hadn’t received this training, I would not have come to this stage,” she says, noting that her shrimp production has increased significantly. “It is more than double.” Today, Shipra has around 4 to 4.5 ha of land. “I bought land,” she says. And that’s not all. “After all these years I have managed to build houses, provide education for my children.” Shipra is eager to share the skills she has learned with others. “Now other people come to me, wanting to learn shrimp farming techniques,” she says. “They seek advice from me on how to become successful. This has all become possible because I followed the instructions under the project.” “People refer to my success...” The video also introduces us to Monowara Begum, a crop farmer from Uttar Monikura, Mymensingh, in the north of the country. Three years ago, Monowara joined a Village Based Organization (VBO) under the Food Security Project supported by FAO, and began to learn about improved farming techniques such as Integrated Pest Management (IPM), and about food safety issues. “I used to put excessive pesticides without knowing the correct doses,” she confesses. But thanks to the training she received through the VBO, she has learned that “improper use of pesticides caused diseases.” “By using IPM techniques, we are free from harmful practices,” she says proudly. “Now, I know where to find quality seeds, when and how much fertilizer needs to be used.” In the past, Monowara had trouble growing enough to feed herself and her family. “I used to starve for shortage of rice, but now I sell rice. This year I sold 360 kg of paddy for 40 000 Bangladeshi takas [about US$500]. I used this money to repair my house.” Monowara feels that her newly-learned skills and perseverance have played a key role in her success, and in the respect she is now accorded by others. “I am commonly known as Salma’s mother,” she says (Salma being her eldest daughter). “People refer to my success; they say, if we could work hard like Salma’s mother, we would also be successful.” Inspiration Lastly, we meet Eliza Khan, a dairy farmer from Routara, in the Sirajganj district of Rajshahi in central Bangladesh. Eliza is a beneficiary of an FAO project focusing on smallholder dairy development. Through the project, she was trained in improved dairy farming practices and livestock management. “From this training I learned how to prepare the sheds and how to take care of the cows.” “Milk production gradually increased. As well as consuming, I started supplying the milk to Milk Vita,” she says, referring to the Bangladesh Milk Producers' Co-Operative Union that the project connected her with. “I learned how to produce quality milk so that I can supply good quality milk to Milk Vita and to the locals.” The increased production and marketing opportunities have given Eliza the confidence to grow her business. “I started getting money every week,” she says. “And that inspired me to extend the farm.” Respect Towards the end of the video, we return to Shipra’s shrimp pond for a moment, to hear her thoughts on the role of gender in all this. “Nowadays, men respect their wives’ opinions and wives also respect their husbands’ views,” she says, adding that both have learned “to give value to each other’s contribution.” “Without this, success will not come.” Click here to watch the video."

      "article_text": "An interview with Tacko Ndiaye, Senior Gender Officer in the Gender Equity and Rural Development Division at FAO, on the Zero Hunger Challenge Blog. © FAO / Alessia Pierdomenico To celebrate International Women’s Month as well as the 2016 African Union Year of Human Rights, staff at the Zero Hunger Challenge Blog sat down with Ms. Ndiaye to talk about the future of women’s rights and empowerment in the Zero Hunger movement, and how zero hunger can advance gender equality. Tacko Ndiaye is a Senior Gender Officer in the Gender Equity and Rural Development Division at FAO, and previously served as Policy Advisor on Economic Empowerment in UN Women’s Africa Division. Today, her work focuses on advancing gender equality and inclusive growth in the agricultural sector. Zero Hunger Challenge: Why did you get involved in this type of work? Tacko Ndiaye: In 2000 I visited a town in Niger to evaluate several rural development programs and saw very young women who were already married and some pregnant at the age of 12 or 13; I saw health centres being built but women wouldn’t go there because their husbands wouldn’t want their wives to be examined by a male doctor; and I saw schools but girls’ enrolment rates were very low. As someone who ultimately wants to see more gender-equal, progressive societies I realized it was places like these where we need to start from. ZHC: 2016 is the African Union Year of Human Rights, with a focus on women’s human rights. What does “women’s rights” and gender equality mean to you? What does full gender equality in the agricultural sector look like? TN: In order to achieve gender parity we need to position gender equality in the agricultural sector in a rights based framework, and consider what inclusive agricultural growth means for both men and women. To me, it means understanding the gender entitlement systems in terms of access to land that is the same size and quality as men; access to productive resources including finance, credit, technology, innovations, improved seeds and fertilizers; access to a voice where agricultural policies are being formulated; and equal participation in rural institutions and local governments. It also means access to business development opportunities along agricultural chains and access to markets. Most importantly, however it means access to safe, nutritious, affordable and available food that meets the nutritional needs of women, including women of reproductive age—so women who are breastfeeding and women who are pregnant. ZHC: How does empowering women and girls as agents of change make a difference for Zero Hunger? What has that looked like in your experience? TN: Empowering women and girls is the best pathway for a Zero Hunger Generation. It is clear that women’s access to productive resources leads to productive gains, enhanced growth and improved outcomes for the next generation. One example of this is the correlation between both women’s education and nutritional status and the health, well-being and nutritional status of their children. Looking at data from Togo on chronic malnutrition among rural children less than 5-years-old, the rates of malnutrition are near 33% among children whose mothers have no education; 25% when mother has a primary education; and 18% when the mother has a secondary education. Thus, investing in the education of rural women has a long-lasting positive effect on the survival and healthy development of their children. ZHC: What types of policies or initiatives already exist through ECOWAS to champion women as leaders, farmers and entrepreneurs – in agribusiness, rural communities and otherwise? How can these be scaled up? TN: We are currently working with ECOWAS to do a policy diagnosis of the National Agricultural Investment Plans (NAIPs) in the ECOWAS region. Based on this analysis we have carried out a policy diagnosis to see how they have or have not addressed the existing gender inequalities in each country. This analysis is then used to influence the implementation of the NAIP in terms of the financing, monitoring and evaluation mechanisms towards polices that are gender responsive. All of this work then feeds into ECOWAS’s ability to develop a Gender in Agriculture Action Plan that can be discussed and developed by the inter-governmental bodies in order to influence the second generation of NAIPs so that they address women’s needs and priorities. ZHC: What role does data, technology and innovation play in mainstreaming gender equality in the agricultural sector? TN: First off, data is key for gender responsive policy making and budget allocation. Why? Because when you’re working on gender equality issues it is very important to know what the baseline is. If you don’t have a baseline you can’t project what is needed for improvement; which is why data is essential to gender mainstreaming and measurement of progress . In addition to data, technology and innovation is essential to unleash the potential of women farmers and to allow them to prosper and benefit equally from inclusive agricultural growth. The best types of technology or innovation for gender mainstreaming are labour-saving technologies; affordable technologies; climate smart and energy efficient technologies. All of these types of technology are female-friendly in that they enhance women’s productivity and income as well as preserve women’s health and well-being! One good example is a machine used to smoke fish which reduces both the women’s workload but also her exposure to indoor smoke and pollution. ZHC: How can we measure if steps towards gender equality in the agricultural sector are being taken? TN: To inform programs and activities it’s a good idea to conduct Country Gender Assessments, which are very much about policy diagnosis. During these assessments, if your analysis articulates gender disparities in several areas you have far better chances to get those reflected and addressed in the results framework and budget allocation so that you can highlight the issues in terms of gender inequalities, opportunities, and incentives. Within these Country Gender Assessments we recommend evaluating the following factors: gender responsive service delivery; inclusive value chains; equal access to the productive resources and opportunities; issues around social protection; capacity building and strengthening of rural institutions; financial inclusion; and the technologies and innovations used to reduce a women’s workload, increase her productivity, and diversify her sources of income. ZHC: Where will the investment come from to fund the types of programs and initiatives needed to push for gender equality in the agricultural sector? TN: In terms of financing gender responsive measures in the agricultural sector we must distinguish between investment and financial inclusion. Financial inclusion means redefining risk and supporting financial institutions that have high performance and that reach large numbers of women, including those in poverty. It also means providing a range of financial services beyond credit or financing, it’s about insurance and other diverse services around the agricultural sector. This type of funding may come from bilateral and multilateral sources in addition to the host country, but is primarily the host country’s responsibility to decide from where and how investment will be sourced. ZHC: What can governments and other stakeholders do to ensure gender equality is mainstreamed in policies and programmes for zero hunger? TN: In short, they can engage with and consult different groups of constituencies around Zero Hunger; work to strengthen gender analytical expertise; improve training and capacity building; leverage women’s voices during the policy-making process; and support women’s advocacy platforms. ZHC: What do you see as being the most important actions that can be taken through zero hunger for gender equality; and vice versa? TN: One of the most obvious is education. Education of mothers has a tremendous impact on children’s nutritional status; so access to education is key. In addition, helping women boost their productive potential through equal access to productive resources and technology is very important when it comes to reducing women’s work burden, especially the unpaid women’s work burden. Finally, encouraging governments to start allocating a portion of their budgets towards gender equality and women’s empowerment will soon be necessary, otherwise all these examples will just remain wishful thinking. ZHC: What would you say to women and girls looking to make a difference in your field? TN: There is a lot to be done so the more the merrier! You don’t always have to enter the field through the hard sciences, I’m a demographer not an agricultural scientist but I have the passion for empowering women in agriculture because that’s where poverty begins. In Africa most women work in agriculture—so the same people who are feeding the world are also the poorest and the ones who have the least access to high quality or nutritious food. So I would say it is this passion to help empower these women that drives our work in this area and so that’s where you should start."

It is a day to celebrate the important role women play in their families, their communities, the workforce and society as a whole. This day is also an ideal time to reflect on the role of women in fisheries and aquaculture, and we’re including below some of FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture's recent activities related to women and their role in the sector. The frequently ‘invisible’ role of women in the seafood industry An interesting FAO GLOBEFISH study, GLOBEFISH report: The role of women in the seafood industry was released last May. Women are essential contributors to the seafood industry, including primary activities, secondary industries and service related to fisheries and aquaculture. At the global scale, estimates illustrate that every one seafood worker out of two is a woman. While men continue to dominate capture fisheries – particularly offshore and industrial fishing— women across all regions are often relegated to processing, local sale and support roles, including cleaning boats and bringing fish to market. These jobs are typically lower paid – in some cases unpaid – and less recognized for their contribution to the economy, employment and food security. Too often, the unofficial status of this work does not afford the women performing it to access the credit and financial resources that could make her work more efficient. But the study points out that it is not only an issue limited to small-scale fisheries in developing countries. Learn more"

      "article_text": "Mahabat Botasheva is the enthusiastic leader of a group of five women in the village of Blagoveshenka in Jalal-Abad province, Kyrgyzstan. Last year, the women started a business in potted flowers. This is the story of how it took root, and how it’s growin © Marat Rahmanov / Community Development Alliance Kyrgyzstan For many years, Mahabat Botasheva dreamed of starting a business in growing and selling potted flowers. But because she lacked the initial capital and business skills, every time she tried to realize her dream she failed. Then, in August of 2015, she joined a self-help group called Dostuk. And that’s when a seed began to sprout. Together with her groupmates, Mahabat attended training sessions on working in a group, managing savings, and recordkeeping. As is typical of the multi-ethnic makeup of Blagoveshenka, the women in the group were of varying ethnic backgrounds – Kyrgyz, Uzbek, and Russian – but they all faced similar challenges in their day-to-day lives, especially when it came to feeding and supporting their families. So when Mahabat suggested they put their newly-acquired training to practical use by starting a joint venture in potted flowers, they all supported the idea of what they called a “beautiful business.” Perseverance Little by little, the group started saving up money. They bought a magazine called “The World of Flowers” and studied it carefully to learn about trends, popular varieties, and the specifics of growing methods and technologies. But even after months of saving, they found that they did not have nearly enough capital with which to start the business and purchase all the necessary inputs, such as pots, seedlings, fertilizers, and working tools. Still, they persevered. In October and November of 2015, the group attended training sessions provided by the joint programme on Accelerating Progress towards the Economic Empowerment of Rural Women (RWEE). Through these training sessions, they developed their business and financial plans and identified potential buyers and marketing channels. Their business plan was selected as the most viable, profitable and beneficial for the economic empowerment of group members in their municipality, and they were granted a loan of 60 000 Kyrgyz soms (about US$800) as starting capital. The group invested another 8 000 Kyrgyz soms (about US$240) from their savings, purchased all the necessary inputs, and started their business. The sweet smell of success So far, it seems the business is blooming. In less than two months since startup, income from sales exceeded 93 000 Kyrgyz soms (about US$1240), and Mahabat is confident that the group will be able to return the starting capital loan to the revolving fund in time for the next group of women to start their business. The remaining income will be reinvested in working capital for the business, and in expanding the assortment of flowers. The role of RWEE Mahabat believes the RWEE programme was key in helping them get their business off the ground. The training enabled the women to acquire the necessary skills for operating a small business, managing income and savings, and planning for growth and development. She also credits their good business and marketing plan, and a strong sense of discipline and responsibility among the women in her group. For example, roles and responsibilities are clearly distributed within the group: Mahabat and Dilbarhan are responsible for the service agreements with the greenhouse where they grow seedlings, for purchasing seeds at the market, and for overseeing other supplies, as well as for financial record keeping and cash flow. Dilbarhan is the group’s treasurer, while Natalya and Ainura are in charge of marketing – they visit offices, schools, and post offices in their village and in neighboring areas, and seek out potential buyers. They also help take care of the flowers. Katcha is the main gardener; she maintains the flowers and keeps records of their growth. She also manages the moving of seedlings, fertilizing, and preparing for sale. Hasiyat’s strengths lie in communicating with buyers, so she operates a stall at the market, where she enjoys talking with customers and asking about their preferences. In another piece of good news, the head of their municipal administration, who is a member of the local committee that is responsible for the selection and monitoring of economic initiatives, has noted their good work and success so far, and has offered further support to grow the business. He has committed to contribute funds from the municipal budget towards the construction of a greenhouse for growing flowers. Mahabat proudly reports that she has already found a suitable plot of land for rent and that the group has already made a cost estimate. They plan to start construction as soon as they have repaid the starting capital and built back a sufficient fund of savings. And finally, of course, the women are expecting a large number of orders for the celebration of International Women’s Day on 8 March. They’re looking forward to it."

With training and support from the RWEE programme, the women have not only been able to increase their yields, but also to market their surplus and expand their activities.

Like all the women in the group, Zoila recognizes the tangible benefits of her active participation in the programme. She has been trained in topics that have enabled her to increase and enhance her production and income, diversify her family’s nutrition and improve their health and well-being.

      "article_text": "Across Liberia’s Montserrado County, a special programme is enabling market women to take their businesses — and their lives — to the next level. © UN Women Liberia The Next Level Business Programme is an initiative of the Government of Liberia and the United Nations joint programme on Accelerating Progress towards the Economic Empowerment of Rural Women (RWEE). Implemented through EduCARE Liberia in collaboration with the Ministry of Gender, Children, and Social Protection; the Ministry of Agriculture; the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Food Programme, it provides specialized business training to local market women in 25 targeted markets. The women learn how to save and manage money, access credit, and expand their businesses and increase their profits. “As the programme name implies, Next Level lifts the market women to another level in their businesses. Where before they were ‘selling anyhow and using their money anyhow,’ through the programme they are gaining the skills to turn their businesses around. The programme is looking at women who feel embarrassed to go to the banks and to turn them into account holders—saving and regularly borrowing and repaying loans.” — Lusu K Sloan, President, Liberian Market Association (LMA) With a cost per beneficiary of US$190, the programme shows how quick impact, low cost interventions can turn women who were ‘selling anyhow and using their money anyhow’ into business-savvy entrepreneurs who earn respect and recognition in the marketplace. Annie Weah, Careysburg Market Annie Weah of Careysburg Market is one such woman. As a beneficiary of the Next Level Business Programme, she wasted no time in putting her training to work. For starters, the programme showed Annie the benefits of opening a bank account and the importance of saving money, and this enabled her to purchase more goods for sale and expand her business. She now owns several market stalls, and has started a business in selling sacks of cold water in the market. The cold water business is thriving — with sales of up to 200 sacks of cold water a day bringing in an income of US$50 before expenses — and Annie employs three marketers to run it while she manages her stalls. Before, Annie was renting her home in the nearby village of Bentol, where she lives with her husband, who is a high school teacher, and their seven children. But thanks to the regular income from her business, the family has been able to transition from renting to homeownership. Moreover, they are now able to pay the children’s day care and school fees which, for a total of US$450 per year, were a major burden in the past. A key aspect of the Next Level Programme is that the facilitators and trainers are market women themselves. This ensures local ownership and ongoing peer-to-peer support. In fact, Annie credits much of her learning and success to the patience of her Next Level Programme teacher, Margaret, whose lessons in customer service, money management, and business planning have helped Annie to become a role model not only in her family and community, but also in Careysburg Market. Mamie Sieh, Careysburg Market Mamie Sieh is also from Careysburg. Mamie used to sell used clothing in the market, but due to a series of poor business decisions she lost much of her capital and had to turn to selling soft drinks, a far less profitable business. After hearing about the Next Level Business Programme and seeing for herself the way programme beneficiaries were able to expand their businesses and transform their lives, Mamie felt motivated to join the programme and learn how to take her business to the next level. Today, as a Next Level trainee, Mamie is gaining the knowledge and skills to rebuild her used clothing business. She credits the programme with teaching her not only how to record purchases and sales, but how to curb unnecessary purchases and save by separating ‘needs’ from ‘wants.’ She is starting to regain her faith in herself, and feels confident that she will not repeat the mistakes she made in the past: now, she knows how to save and better manage her money, how to run her business, and how to plan for the long term. Musu Kollie, Harper Central Market Musu Kollie is 61, and has been at Harper Central Market since 1983, where she sells palm nuts. Before studying with the Next Level Business Programme, Musu used to spend all her profits on food and household necessities. But now she understands the importance of saving. “I never managed to separate my personal money from business money,” she says. “I’ve always lived a hand-to-mouth life until the Next Level Programme came.” Even Musu’s grandchildren have commented on how the programme has improved her ability to make good business decisions. They see their grandmother reinvesting her profits to maintain and expand her business. And moreover, they see that she is able to pay their school fees. Keeping up with her grandchildren’s tuition payments had been a continuous source of stress for Musu, so she is especially proud to say that she no longer owes the school a penny. “It’s economics,” she says of the business skills that the programme has given her. “The people are teaching us economics.” Korto Flomo, Kakata Central Market Although she is still only a trainee in the Next Level Business Programme, Korto Flomo of Kakata Central Market is already reaping the benefits of her new skills and knowledge. In the past, Korto had often wanted to expand her dry goods business, but she worried that if she did, thieves would be more likely to steal her wares and she would be at greater risk of a violent attack. Thanks to the programme, Korto is now ready to grow her business, because she is taking the proper measures to secure her goods day and night. The programme has also enabled Korto to increase sales through better customer relations. Before joining, she didn’t know how to engage with her customers; she would simply wait for them to either ‘buy or go.’ She has since learned the importance of communicating with each customer, finding ways to meet his or her needs, and building long-term relationships. She now says proudly that if she has a customer once, she will have that customer again! In December of 2015, RWEE Liberia hosted a formal Graduation Ceremony to honor hundreds of women like Annie, Mamie, Musu, and Korto, who had successfully completed the Next Level Business Programme.

      "article_text": "For the first time in its history, Guatemala's Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food has a comprehensive Policy on Gender Equality. © FAO / R. Grisolia Developed with the support of FAO, IFAD, UN Women and WFP, the Institutional Policy for Gender Equality and Strategic Implementation Framework 2014-2023 represents the Ministry's commitment to systematically mainstream gender in all areas of its work, including its institutional mechanisms and with special emphasis on integrated rural development and food security and nutrition programmes and processes. Approved in March by José Sebastián Marcucci Ruíz, Guatemala's Minister of Agriculture, Livestock and Food, the new Policy also represents a key milestone in Guatemala's implementation of the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). FAO Gender and Development Officer Hajnalka Petrics has been involved in the process since it first began in 2013. This week, she stopped by to explain the Organization's role in developing Guatemala's new Policy, and how the implementation of CEDAW can result in improved food and nutrition security for women and men in rural areas... How did all this begin? In September of 2013 the Government of Guatemala requested technical assistance for the country's recently-established Special Cabinet for Women ( Gabinete Especifico de la Mujer ) – in particular, the Cabinet's work on implementing the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW). How does CEDAW fit into the larger picture of ensuring food and nutrition security in rural areas? We know that gender equality and the empowerment of rural women are key to eradicating hunger, malnutrition and rural poverty. CEDAW is the only international human rights treaty that addresses rural women directly and specifically through its Article 14. It recognizes the critical roles that women play in the development of rural economies and societies at large and in ensuring food security and nutrition and the need to improve the recognition and protection of their rights worldwide. States that ratified the Convention commit themselves to plan and undertake specific measures to combat discrimination against women in rural areas. In this sense, CEDAW can serve as a framework for national action to end such discrimination. Its implementation can serve as a pathway to rural women's empowerment and gender equality. This, in turn, helps to create an enabling environment for greater food and nutrition security – for both men and women – in rural communities. What was FAO's role in developing the Policy and what did the process entail? Different FAO offices – including the FAO Representation in Guatemala, the Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean and FAO headquarters – worked together to support the Policy formulation. We worked with the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food to revise the draft Policy, ensuring that gender equality and women’s empowerment can be factored into the implementation plan of the National Integrated Rural Development Policy and that a gender-sensitive approach is foreseen in the provision of agricultural and rural extension services. The policy also provides strategic guidance for gender-sensitive food and nutrition programmes. However, this was only the tip of the iceberg. In addition to the work of revising and refining the Policy, FAO's support involved a three-pronged approach to creating an institutional framework in which the Policy could then be implemented: First, we focused on capacities within the Ministry itself. We worked with twenty Ministry directors on capacity assessment and awareness-raising around CEDAW, Article 14, and the Ministry’s related obligations, to make sure that the perspectives of rural women are considered in the planning and implementation of food security and rural development projects and programs. Next, we looked beyond the Ministry. Because rural women face multiple challenges in many spheres of life – including health and sanitation, literacy and education, employment, land, etc. – the full and meaningful implementation of CEDAW’s Article 14 requires coordination across a range of entities. This is why we facilitated a multi-stakeholder workshop with representatives from the gender units of the Ministry of Social Development, the Ministry of Health and Social Prevention, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of the Environment and the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare, as well as organizational representatives from the National Forestry Institution, the Secretariat of Agrarian Affairs, the National Office for Women, the Central National School of Agriculture, the Secretariat of Food Security and Nutrition, and The Land Fund. The idea was to bring these groups together for the first time to discuss the unique challenges faced by rural women in each of their different sectors, and to outline opportunities for ongoing coordination and collaboration. In particular, the workshop resulted in the establishment of an ongoing \"Technical Group on women in rural development in the framework of Article 14 of CEDAW.\" This group will focus on continued coordination among the sectoral ministries involved in implementing Article 14 and in formulating gender-sensitive policies on national food security and rural development. Lastly, we organized a meeting with a key civil society organization representing rural indigenous Guatemalan women – the Rural Women’s Alliance ( Alianza de Mujeres Rurales ). Again, it was the first time staff from the Gender Unit of the Ministry met with representatives from the Alliance and heard their perspectives on the living conditions of rural indigenous women. What's next? The approval of the Policy is of course a major milestone. But in many ways the work has only just begun. The Gender Unit of the Ministry has requested FAO's continued technical support in moving forward with the Policy, including the development of the Policy’s implementation, monitoring and evaluation plans. FAO will also assist in the capacity development of Ministry staff towards formulating, monitoring and evaluating gender-responsive food security programmes and projects.

We sat down with FAO Gender and Development Specialist Francesca Distefano to learn more about the disease in general, and its effect on rural women in particular. Can you tell us something about the disease itself? What is PPR and where is it prevalent? Peste des petits ruminants or PPR – sometimes known as sheep and goat plague – is a highly contagious, widespread and devastating disease that affects small ruminants (the name means small ruminant plague in French) – essentially sheep and goats. The disease is caused by a virus of the same family as the rinderpest virus, which was globally eradicated in 2011. PPR was first identified in West Africa in 1942, and after rapid expansion over the past 15 years it's now in over 70 countries in Africa, Asia and the Middle East. What are the effects of PPR and who does the disease affect? In untreated animals the disease can bring on fever, respiratory problems and diarrhea, along with dramatic loss in weight, milk production and reproductive capability. Affected animals become depressed, weak and severely dehydrated in a matter of days. The virus can infect up to 90 percent of a flock, and up to 70 percent of infected animals may die. According to FAO's Animal Production and Health Division , PPR causes billions of dollars in losses every year. In the United Republic of Tanzania, for example, the cumulative annual loss due to PPR is estimated to be around US$67.9 million. In Pakistan, the disease causes annual losses of more than US$342 million. The PPR virus does not infect humans, but because the disease attacks small ruminants, it's a major concern for poor rural households in developing countries, where goats and sheep serve as critical assets. By providing a steady flow of milk, meat, skins and wool throughout the year, as well as income opportunities and financial flexibility, these animals play a key role in ensuring food security and livelihood resilience in rural communities. By killing off their livestock, PPR pushes millions of smallholder families deeper into poverty – increasing malnutrition, hunger and food insecurity. In addition, actions to contain the disease – such as depopulating diseased flocks, restricting movement and banning trade in small ruminants and their by-products – hurt already vulnerable farming communities and stifle overall economic growth. Why are women particularly affected by PPR? Women’s livelihoods are particularly threatened because women make up the majority of those caring for and raising small ruminants. Although livestock management systems vary among countries, rural women are usually the ones who manage small ruminants and rely on them for their livelihoods. The reasons for this relate to existing gender inequalities in agriculture and rural development. Because rural women frequently lack access to natural resources such as land and water, and to inputs and services such as quality fodder and veterinary drugs, small ruminants represent a more accessible source of food and income for them. Compared with larger animals, they are cheaper to buy and easier to manage; they require fewer inputs and less investment; they reproduce relatively quickly; they can be sold or exchanged relatively easily; and they are generally more resilient to adverse climate conditions and drought. The longer-term consequences of PPR are also different for women, again, because of existing gender inequalities in rural agricultural contexts. When PPR affects their flocks, rural women are less likely to have access to the inputs and services that are needed to help manage the disease and minimize its impact. These can include veterinary drugs and care, as well as technologies, information and training on disease recognition and management. What needs to be done to enable men and women to tackle this disease? PPR eradication is possible – a safe, potent and acceptable vaccine is now widely available – but a few issues need particular attention. First, communication and awareness-raising on the disease and on animal health: This should focus both on understanding the disease and on managing it, such that those who care for small ruminants – whether male or female – are able to recognize symptoms, understand effects and take appropriate, effective action to minimize losses and prevent it from spreading further. Second, a gender-sensitive approach to the actual implementation of control programmes, including the delivery of the vaccine itself: This requires a focus on both the men and the women who keep small ruminant livestock, recognizing their different needs and contexts and ensuring that both receive the drugs, technologies and training they need. Finally, the establishment of community-based animal health delivery systems: These would provide rural women and men with opportunities to access animal health care at affordable prices, within easy reach of their homes and villages. This is especially relevant for women, whose household responsibilities and workload often prevent them from traveling as far as men to get the inputs, training, and services they need to save their flocks.

      "article_text": "This week, FAO unveiled the new and improved Gender and Land Rights Database (GLRD). Consisting of three main sections – country profiles, gender and land-related statistics, and the all-new Legislation Assessment Tool – the site aims to serve as a hub of © FAO / Franco Mattioli The new version of the website will also highlight key publications and resources related to gender-equitable land tenure, and feature regular online discussions on targeted issues relating to gender and land in different countries and contexts. We sat down with Ana Paula de la O Campos, Naomi Kenney and Christine Legault of the GLRD Core Team to hear about what's new and what's better: Let's start with the all-new Legislation Assessment Tool. Can you tell us a little about it? While the GLRD site has always offered country profiles and statistics, the Legislation Assessment Tool (LAT) is a completely new feature. It offers 30 indicators for measuring progress towards gender equity in land tenure in national policy and legal frameworks in different countries around the world. Selecting an indicator brings up an interactive world map showing the stage of incorporation of an indicator into a country’s policy and legal framework – the different colours reflect how far an indicator has been incorporated on a scale from 0 to 4. It's a very practical, evidence-based tool for visualizing the legal intricacies around men and women's access to land in different countries: you can get a sense of positive and negative elements in the policy and legal frameworks, and you can use the assessment results to inform policy and law-making processes. How does the LAT work? The LAT uses the GLRD country profile information to assess the extent to which a country enables gender-equitable land tenure from a legal perspective. Basically, it looks at everything in a country that is required to safeguard women's land rights from all angles: the constitution, inheritance law, nationality law and family law, the ratification of international conventions, decentralisation through formal vs. customary institutions, the existence of specific measures such as quotas to support women's representation in land-related institutions, grievance mechanisms and legal aid for land disputes, and so on. In addition to good practices, the indicators draw on FAO’s Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security and the Technical Guide on Governing land for women and men . The country profiles on our website are regularly updated, so as a consequence the LAT will be too. This means that over time, the LAT will reflect actual progress across the different indicators as well. In fact, we're already working with FAO colleagues to look at using some of these indicators to monitor programmes in women's land rights in the post-2015 development agenda. What made you decide to develop the LAT? How did it come about? We talked to website users and partners who felt the country profiles were too long and time-consuming to read all the way through. Sometimes they didn't understand why certain information was there, or how it was relevant. This is understandable – it's not always obvious how a certain law can have an effect on women's land rights. We realized we needed a way to illustrate the situation in each country more clearly and concisely. We also needed a tool that we could use in countries, to provide policy and legal advisory support to FAO’s member countries on strengthening their national frameworks to make them more conducive to gender-equitable land tenure, especially in the context of the Voluntary Guidelines. In this sense, we've already begun using the LAT: the tool was recently used in the implementation of the Voluntary Guidelines in Sierra Leone. So far we have 17 countries available in the LAT section of the website, and we'll be adding more in the coming months. What about the other two main sections of the site – the country profiles and the gender and land-related statistics? The country profiles have been a familiar feature of the GLRD since it was originally launched back in 2010. At that time we had around 70 country profiles, but we've since added more, bringing the number up to 83 – and we keep them all regularly updated of course. Each profile provides key facts on gender and land rights in a given country, across a range of relevant contexts including constitutions, family law, succession law, land law and customary and religious law, as well as policies and programmes. In the past, the information in these country profiles was not easily searchable. If you were interested in women's land rights in a certain country, you had to click on the country profile and read all of it in its entirety. Of course, this is not how people use the internet these days, so for the new site we created a search function that enables you to pull from the country profiles by topic. If you're interested in Bangladesh for example, but only in terms of information related to customary law, you can select that. The search will then extract the information related to customary norms and institutions, traditional authorities, discrepancies or gaps between statutory and customary laws and so on. And you still have the option of reading the full country profile of course! For the statistics area of the site as well, we've made some major improvements. In the past we only had one meaningful statistic – about the share of male and female agricultural holders. Because of our name, most people who came to our site expected to find more data. Instead, they would find that there wasn't much in terms of data and statistics, and that most of it was not very recent. So in addition to updating all the information and statistics, we partnered with the FAO Statistics Division and other organizations to gather all the available data on gender and land and publish it here, and to develop new statistics as well. In particular, we're using a new interactive data map, which does a great job of showing the discrepancies between men and women's land rights among countries in both numbers and colours. - Information is quickly accessed by selection of indicators in scroll-down menu and displayed visually thanks to an interactive map. - Most recent land-related statistics disaggregated by gender, including distribution of landholders by sex and the incidence of landowners by sex, among others. - Useful for generating and printing tables and graphs as well. And the online discussions? The idea with the online discussions is to encourage stakeholders at country level – NGOs, civil society and independent experts – to engage with a specific issue in a country and share their experiences on the ground. When we organize an online discussion about a country, we encourage participants to read and respond to the country profile for that country. This helps fuel the discussion of course, but it also creates a natural feedback loop that enables us to validate the information on our site, and to make updates and improvements as needed. We've had two online discussions so far – one on land titling in Peru and another on legal pluralism in Madagascar. Summaries of both discussions can be found here . Are there any plans for additional developments in the near future? While we don't plan to add any major features or functionality in the short term, we do intend to continue building on the work done so far, in terms of new and improved content, including publications, regularly-updated statistics and more online discussions.

It is the latest in a series of courses developed under the EU-FAO programme “ Improved Global Governance for Hunger Reduction ”. We sat down with Ilaria Sisto, FAO Gender and Development Officer and Lead Technical Coordinator for the course, to learn more: Can you tell us why and how the idea for such a course came about? For some time now, there has been strong recognition among FAO's member countries of the importance of gender equality in development planning and programming for food and nutrition security. But in many of these countries there is general lack of capacity when it comes to the design and implementation of truly gender-responsive policies and programmes, and in the generation of sex-disaggregated data on food and nutrition security to inform, support or evaluate them. In essence, the course was designed to address this gap and respond to these needs. It will enable policy-makers and development practitioners at country-level to better address gender equality issues in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of food and nutrition security policies, programmes and projects. And it will support statisticians in producing the kind of sex-disaggregated data and gender-sensitive statistics that are needed for improved policy and programme development. Of course, the course is also meant to strengthen capacity among development practitioners and humanitarian officers in international organizations. FAO staff is strongly encouraged to take this course, as part of their learning programme. Who are the target audiences, and how is the course structured to serve their needs? The course was designed to meet the needs of policy- and decision-makers in ministries responsible for food and nutrition security, and of programme and project staff and other development / humanitarian practitioners in the government, NGO, civil society and private sectors, as well as in FAO and other international organizations. Fourteen lessons are spread across three units: Overview of gender concepts and principles , Gender in Food and nutrition security policy and legislation , and Gender in food and nutrition security programming . Specific topics include the production of gender statistics, gender analysis frameworks for policy and programme design, and the formulation of gender advocacy strategies to influence food and nutrition security policies and legislation. The course features practical tools, case studies and lessons learned from past development and humanitarian interventions. The modular design allows for self-paced learning, so that learners can pick and choose individual lessons to build specific skills depending on their work-related responsibilities, tasks and interests. How do you envision the ways in which the course will ultimately impact and affect rural women in developing regions? By applying the knowledge acquired through this course, learners can formulate policies and design and implement programmes that not only avoid re-enforcing existing gender inequalities, but actually reduce them, ensuring that men and women farmers in the developing world benefit equally from such policies and programmes, and have equal access to the resources, services and opportunities they need. Can you tell us a little about how the course was developed? The course was developed through a participatory and multidisciplinary process. In January 2013, together with the Office for Partnerships, Advocacy and Capacity Development, we organized a consultative workshop at FAO headquarters, bringing together 25 experts from 15 national and international institutions. We selected these participants based not only on their experience and knowledge of gender and food security issues, but also in terms of how well they represented the needs of the audiences we had in mind. Through the workshop, we were able to identify the broad course objectives, the specific target audiences, and the knowledge and skill areas that needed coverage among those target audiences – especially in terms of their spheres of work and responsibilities. The curriculum outline was consolidated in March, and authors were identified for the different lessons. We used a system of peer review and feedback (including FAO colleagues and Gender Focal Points, fellow authors and other stakeholders) to edit, revise and refine the lessons’ drafts into finished content. FAO's Office for Partnerships, Advocacy and Capacity Development then designed and developed a fully-fledged interactive e-learning course, in collaboration with our subject matter experts.

It represents the kind of happy ending you can have when everyone in and around a rural community – from the village chi © Christiane Monsieur It was July of 2011. Zara Issa stood before the 40 members of the Gomni Mate women’s group of Banizoumbou, a rural village in the municipality of Dantiandou, Niger, some 70 km from Niamey. Zara, the president of the group, held two sheets of paper in her proud hands. On them were the official seal of the canton, the signatures of the canton authorities, the signatures of the representatives of the women’s group, and the fingerprints (as signatures) of eight village landowners. The seal and signatures attested to the leasing of 2.75 hectares of dune land at the edge of Banizoumbou to the women’s group for 99 years! The women – and eventually their daughters and granddaughters – would be able to plant fruit trees and vegetables on their own plot of land, for consumption or for sale in the market of Niamey. This was the first time that the women of Banizoumbou had obtained secure, legal, long-term access to land. What's more, this was good, quality land, close to an artesian well and other amenities. The long-lease contract entitles the group to plant trees as well as winter and off-season crops, and sets real guarantees for sustainable, environmentally-friendly use of the land. How it all began The Gomni Mate women's group (“May good deeds be done”) is an offshoot of the Dimitra community listeners' club of Banizoumbou, one of many such clubs set up in the area by FAO Dimitra and its local partner, NGO-VIE Kande Ni Bayra. What are FAO Dimitra community listeners clubs? FAO Dimitra community listeners’ clubs are made up of men, women and youth who come together in groups – mixed or otherwise – to organize and work towards change in their communities. Since 2008, the clubs have been set up in several sub-Saharan African countries, and meet regularly to discuss development issues and challenges, and to find solutions together. The listeners' clubs are equipped with wind-up, solar-powered radios and, in some cases, fleets of solar-charged cell phones. As members discuss topics and share concerns, priorities and needs, their conversations are aired live on partnering radio stations or recorded for later broadcast. This stimulates discussions in other clubs – which are broadcast in turn – focusing on concrete actions that can be taken in the community and keeping the conversation going among all the Dimitra clubs in the area. By creating a consistent, sustainable and gender-sensitive forum for information sharing and participatory communication, the Dimitra approach empowers rural people – especially women and youth. It enables them not only to have a voice, but a voice that counts. Formed in 2010, the Dimitra club in Banizoumbou has been a success from the very start, and continues to attract the participation of many village inhabitants. Club members meet several times a week to discuss and act on issues such as food security, health and sanitation, as well as improving nutrition, market gardening and access to water and land. The club also engages in larger debates and discussions organized by Radio Famay, a community radio station broadcasting from Dantiandou. One such debate in 2011 focused on women's access to land, and called for suggestions and strategies to improve it. Members of the different Dimitra community listeners’ clubs in the region shared their views with each other and with other radio listeners, and a range of suggestions were exchanged and discussed at length. Both women and men engaged in the debate, and many of the region's men called in to express their thoughts on the different strategies for giving women access to their land. In particular the chief of Banizoumbou, whom the women from the Dimitra clubs had lobbied in the past, took a keen interest, and brought together the village landowners to discuss matters and move towards a final decision: a 99-year lease for the women.One idea was simply to donate land to women (along with supporting legal documents), but this was rejected in view of the difficulties that would arise later, if the group to which the land was given ceased to exist. Other options included buying land for women; having local authorities confiscate plots of land for community purposes and allocating it to women; and finally, of lending land to individuals or women's groups on a long-term basis. This last idea was viewed as the easiest to implement and the least restrictive. Gains for the whole community We may well wonder what made these eight landowners agree to lease away part of their land to a group of women – for an entire century! In the end, it was a case of everyone – both within the village and beyond, from the community level to the state and from local NGOs to international organizations – communicating effectively and constructively towards potential gains for the whole community: In addition to supporting the initial setup of the listeners' clubs and the women's group itself, the NGO-VIE Kande Ni Bayra had promised to help the women improve their land if they became landowners. They had also helped the women write a letter requesting government permission to use the nearby artesian well for their crops, and the government (through the Ministry of Hydraulics) had agreed. These were all good signs that the land would be well-used and productive and that the whole community would benefit. Finally, the village chief and various other prominent villagers (including one of the religious leaders) supported the women’s cause and helped them to consult with the landowners. How the club helped The community listeners’ club played a crucial role in securing the lease contract: the idea itself came from club discussions, as well as the feasibility of the arrangement. And in a more general sense, the club was key to building confidence among its members – especially the women – to voice their opinions, present arguments and engage in dialogue and debate towards shared collective problem-solving and progress. The negotiation process lasted more than eight months: given that each parcel of land belonged to an entire family, each of the landowners had to convince all of the heirs to support the initiative. This was a major challenge for the heads of some families! In certain cases, they had to make a decision without the consent of all the heirs, for the sake of the family’s honour. After all, sharing one’s wealth with the community is a traditional value. Zara Issa was right to cherish those two pieces of paper: unless the Gomni Mate women's group breaks up or their business fails (and they decide themselves to formally terminate the lease), the land is theirs. For a century. Sources: FAO. 2012. Dimitra Newsletter N° 21 – February 2012. Brussels."

      "article_text": "Empowering women is essential to achieving a world without hunger. This is the message highlighted by the Rome-based UN agencies and partners during this year’s commemoration of International Women’s Day. WFP Executive Director Ertharin Cousin, former President of Ireland Mary Robinson, FAO Director-General José Graziano da Silva and IFAD Vice-President Michel Mordasini discuss the key role that women play in agriculture and in food and nutrition security. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the World Food Programme (WFP) teamed up with the International Development Law Organization (IDLO), the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and the World Farmers’ Organisation (WFO) in a joint event to commemorate International Women’s Day 2014, titled “Closing the gender gap in agriculture’’. Hosted at FAO, the event was opened by FAO Director-General José Graziano da Silva, who stressed the importance of rural women for the future of global food security, particularly in the context of family farming. FAO Director-General José Graziano da Silva shared an example of women's empowerment from the Zero Hunger Program in Brazil. “Family farmers are the dominant force in global food production,” said Graziano da Silva. “Rural women are an important part of this, not just as farmers but also in processing and preparing food, and in local markets. There is no doubt in our mind that increasing support of family farming in general, and to women in particular, can improve food security and nutrition.” He welcomed the event as “an opportunity to share experiences of effective ways to reduce gender gaps for our common cause, which is to end hunger and make food systems sustainable,’’ adding that, “as this year´s [UN] celebration points out: equality for women is progress for all.’’ IFAD Vice-President Michel Mordasini also highlighted how empowering women means empowering families. “Closing the gender gap in agriculture is not just a women’s issue, it is a whole family issue,” said Mordasini. “Numerous studies show that when women earn money, they are more likely than men to spend it on food for the family. It is not surprising therefore that there is a strong correlation between women’s empowerment and reduced rates of malnutrition.” A better future for all WFP Executive Director Ertharin Cousin reiterated the Rome-based UN agencies’ full commitment to closing the gender gap in agriculture. WFP Executive Director Ertharin Cousin noted that the gender gap is still “wide and deep”, citing examples of how female farmers have less access to land, fertilizers and machinery as well as financial and extension services. “Closing the gender gap is everyone’s business,” Cousin continued. “Empowering women means that the entire family benefits, it means that the entire community benefits, it means the entire country benefits and ultimately the entire global world benefits.” “We ask that member states fully consider and promote the resilience of women and ensure that gender equality lies at the heart of the post-2015 global framework,’’ she said. Keynote speaker Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland and current head of the Mary Robinson Foundation – Climate Justice, discusses the importance of climate change, gender equality and food security for sustainable global development. Keynote speaker H.E. Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland and UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and current head of the Mary Robinson Foundation – Climate Justice emphasized that for global development to be sustainable the issues of climate change, gender equality and food security must all go hand in hand. “The right to food is not an abstract commitment, it is a fact of life and something we are committed to providing for every man, woman and child on the planet,” H.E. Robinson stated. “We can no longer treat it as an aspiration.” “If we want to support the empowerment of women we have to start with girls,” she continued. “Girls growing up have to understand, right from the very beginning, that they are equal to their brothers, that they are important members of their families. The role of fathers is incredibly important in relation to girls – if they are valued by their fathers, that’s empowering for girls.” IFPRI Director-General Shenggen Fan cited the importance of integrating gender into research and the need for “systematic evidence” to better understand gender gaps in agriculture and to move from “knowledge to action”. “We found that addressing gender gaps is critical for the success of agricultural development programs,” he added. Talip Kilic, a research economist from the World Bank’s Poverty and Inequality Group, shared data from surveys undertaken in six different African countries – Ethiopia, Malawi, Niger, Nigeria, Tanzania and Uganda – but stressed that the gender gap changes dramatically across different settings and that more country-specific data needs to be gathered to formulate effective national policies. Experts from many different countries shared their perspectives on how best to close the gender gap. Men and women working together In the panel debate that followed, experts from UN and partner organizations shared their perspectives on the gender gap. Maria Helena Semedo, FAO Deputy Director-General, Natural Resources, stressed that closing the gap depends on equal and shared involvement from both sides: “Men and women should be fully part of the decision-making process at all levels,” she summed up. The panelists discussed progress to date in terms of increased awareness of gender issues, further recognition of rural women’s invaluable contributions to agriculture and greater availability of gender-disaggregated data. In addition, they noted an increase in development research and new studies that examine the role of women in agricultural productivity, as well as the causes and consequences of the gender gap and how best to address it. They also showcased significant work in gender equality and rural women’s empowerment, including improvements to outdated legislation in countries such as Mali, Uganda and Viet Nam. In addition to Semedo, the panelists included H.E. Tehmina Janjua, Ambassador of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan; Irene Khan, Director-General, IDLO; Maria Helena Semedo, Deputy Director-General NR, FAO; Elisabeth Rasmusson, Assistant Executive Director, Partnership and Governance Services, WFP; Hoonae Kim, Director, Asia and Pacific Region, IFAD and Rose Akaki, member of WFO – Uganda (Kampala). The event was moderated by British journalist and broadcaster Juliette Foster."

      "article_text": "The phrase “unity gives joy” sums up the first Dimitra Community Listeners’ Clubs Forum for the Tshopo District, held in the town of Isangi, in the Orientale Province of the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). The Forum, held from 9–10 August 2013, brough © FAO The listeners’ clubs have been set up since the end of 2012 as a gender-sensitive project to fight poverty and improve food security, implemented by United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), with funding from the DRC government and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). In addition to the delegates from the clubs, the Forum included representatives from the seven Tshopo community radio stations that are involved in the project and from the United Nations’ Radio Okapi. Traditional chiefs and community leaders also attended, as did representatives from the provincial, district and local government and from project partner institutions in civil society (farm producers' unions, NGOs, etc.). Delegates shared views on how the clubs have changed customs and practices at the individual and household levels, and on how their activities have benefitted the entire rural community. Antoine Magasin, moderator of the community listeners’ club Mandeleo, told his story of change this way: “ Before, I could not even think of carrying water myself and I had money that I used as I wished. But with the community listeners’ clubs I now regularly talk with my wife about the expenses and other family problems. I find that this collaboration between my wife and I has brought peace to my household.” Another delegate added, “ In our village, 36 km on the road to Buta, we had many problems to get drinkable water. Women had to leave very early in the morning to go to the forest to find fresh water and they did not come back before midday. Now the club has built a water well in the village and when one needs to collect water it only takes 5 to 10 minutes. The community is very happy about this and many more people have joined the club.” The far-reaching benefits of the clubs also caught the attention of local authorities. As Guillaume Bamemba Ingolo, Chief of Sector of Babelota noted, “The community listeners’ clubs help mobilize the population for community works. With the activities of the clubs, the roads and the agricultural service roads are being rehabilitated. The clubs also helped us settle land conflicts that are very frequent in our area. The more people are sitting together the more they break down any potential conflicts.” The listeners’ clubs enable men and women to exchange information, knowledge and opinions and to share in decision-making, with a view towards making both men and women active participants in their communities. But what the delegates saw happening in their villages goes far beyond participation in the clubs themselves. Today, women are involved in community activities, including traditional ceremonies as well as in community radio programs. In an area where it has traditionally been forbidden for women to speak up in public, this is no small feat. Sarah Missoui, a member of one of the listeners’ clubs gave an example: “As a woman, I could never lead an organization where there were men. Today I am the moderator of a listeners’ club where there are men. We sensitize the population together. We work in the fields together and we even go fishing with the men!” Joseph Mukambwa, a traditional Kombe chief in the Isangi territory, offered his comments on the increased involvement of women in leadership and decision-making: “In the tradition it was never accepted that a woman would inherit customary leadership. Today we realize that women carry the same human values as men. This is why we think that women should also apply to lead the traditional entities.” The Forum also highlighted some of the more general results of the FAO-Dimitra project. These include improved access to information on topics chosen by club members; behavioral changes in agricultural practices and eating habits; removal of food taboos; women speaking out and participating in decision-making and the ability of the clubs to be self-sustaining. The project, titled “ Listeners’ clubs, fight against poverty, food security and gender” focuses on empowering women and men producers, improving women and youth’s leadership and strengthening their livelihoods and food security. To date, it has supported the creation of 60 Dimitra community listeners’ clubs with over 2 275 direct members (half being women). The clubs cover 167 villages across the Orientale Province, and directly benefit over 18 000 people."

      "article_text": "Though progress has been made in promoting and protecting women’s rights, women and girls continue to face discrimination in many facets of their lives. In agriculture, for example, discrimination causes female farmers to have less access than their male © FAO / Vasily Maximov These inequalities impose costs on families, the sector, society and national economies – in addition to the women themselves. To promote equality between men and women in agriculture and rural development, FAO has produced a guide for agricultural ministry officials and agricultural and rural development specialists. This guide shows how an international agreement prohibiting discrimination against women can be used to shape agricultural and rural development programmes to ensure men and women the same opportunities. FAO Gender and Development Officer Hajnalka Petrics, co-author of “ Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) - A tool for gender-sensitive agriculture and rural development policy and programme formulation - guidelines for Ministries of Agriculture and FAO ,” explains how the Convention can be used to bring about positive and sustainable results in the lives of rural women, men, girls and boys. What is the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)? CEDAW is an international human rights treaty protecting the rights of women. As of today, 187 states have ratified the Convention – meaning they are legally obliged to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women in all areas of life. They have also agreed to ensure women’s full social and economic development and advancement so they have the same rights and freedom as men. What progress has been made in eliminating discrimination? Significant gender equality gains have been made since CEDAW was adopted more than 30 years ago. Equality between men and women has been enshrined in constitutions, many gender discriminatory laws and practices have been amended and women’s political representation has increased. However, structural disadvantages, discrimination and gender inequalities persist, especially for rural women. Eliminating the root causes of discrimination is a long process that requires strong political will and often a change in cultural norms. CEDAW calls for incorporating the principle of equality of men and women in legal systems, tribunals and other public institutions to eliminate discrimination against women by individuals, organizations or enterprises. What rights does CEDAW ensure for rural women? Article 14 of CEDAW specifies that rural women must be included in development planning and implementation. They are to have access to healthcare, education, credit and social security programmes and enjoy adequate living conditions. While many of the articles of CEDAW have a bearing on rural women, Article 14 refers specifically to rural women and is the most relevant to the mandates of FAO and ministries of agriculture. Its includes recommendations that focus on ensuring rural women’s rights to form self-help groups and co-operatives, to have access to agricultural credit and loans, marketing facilities and technology and to enjoy equal treatment in land and agrarian reforms. What are some recent examples of FAO’s efforts to promote rural women’s’ rights in agriculture and rural development? FAO recently developed guidelines for gender-sensitive agriculture and rural development policy and programme formulation, to show how agriculture and rural development policies, strategies and programmes can be designed to respond to the many challenges rural women face. It suggests practical ways ministries of agriculture, and agricultural and rural development specialists can engage in the CEDAW reporting processes, implement the Convention and formulate agricultural and rural development policies and programmes that respond to the needs and priorities of both women and men. The publication cites a number of cases in which CEDAW provisions were used in legal proceedings and includes some of the Committee’s observations that resulted in concrete programmes that guaranteed women’s full rights. For example, women’s access to land has been improved in places such as Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, where more women now own family farms. Another example is in the Philippines, where the concluding observations were used to support efforts to stop discriminatory acts against rural women in fishing and farming communities. CEDAW has led to laws and policies aimed at enhancing women’s access to rural services, such as water, education and financial services, in yet other countries. Another example is the formulation of a general recommendation on rural women. This recommendation is meant to guide States Parties on the measures to adopt, protect, and respect in order to fulfill the rights of rural women. It is the first time that a general recommendation on Article 14 will be prepared. The processes started in 2012, when FAO, together with IFAD, WFP and UN Women advocated for the drafting of a general recommendation on Article 14. We took this step because Article 14 needed to reflect the new challenges rural women are facing and it also needed to offer more practical guidance on how to boost the impact of the Convention’s provisions. The four organizations prepared a background paper highlighting these challenges and proposing some concrete policy measures, such as investing in and creating infrastructure and community facilities, and developing on- and off- farm-care facilities to reduce rural women’s unpaid and domestic work. Another example is strengthening the capacities of farmer and producer organizations, while ensuring fair opportunities for women to participate and even take on leadership positions. These measures were presented and discussed at the 56th session of CEDAW during a half-day discussion on rural women in October 2013 (article 14 of the Convention on the Elimination of All forms of Discrimination against Women)."

      "article_text": "Family farming and smallholder farming are an important basis for sustainable food production throughout the world. While family farms tend to be highly efficient in terms of agricultural productivity per unit of land, those that produce on a small or med ©FAO/Antonello Proto / FAO Beyond an agricultural model, family farming is a way of life, where both men and women have different roles and responsibilities. As elsewhere, what men and women do and are responsible for is largely determined by what is socially considered acceptable. In many cultures, men serve more often as managers – making decisions about what crops to plant, how much land to use, whether to make by-products and where to sell the food. Their tasks on the family farm can also include preparing the soil for planting and harvesting, while women usually do the planting, weeding and post-harvest processing. It is the combination of men’s and women’s efforts that make family farming work. The challenges family farmers, especially women, face also include the lack of a clear line to divide family life and work. National data from a number of countries show that most unpaid family farmers are women, who also work longer hours than men when both agricultural work and household chores are counted. Family farmers, who tend to be unsalaried workers, miss out on benefits, such as retirement, maternity leave and child care. And here women face greater disadvantages. Female managers of family farms tend to own less land and livestock than their male counterparts, and have less access to financial credit and services, markets to sell their products and time-saving technology. Climate change, food price volatility and economic globalization also create difficulties for family farms. To highlight the important contribution that family farming and smallholder farming can make to food security and poverty eradication, the year 2014 was named the International Year of Family Farming by the UN. “FAO and partners will hold consultations, encouraging countries to adoption policies that support family farmers with social protection programmes and rural services, including medical care and agricultural extension and training,” says Ana Paula Dela O Campos, FAO Gender Policy Officer. “If agricultural policies are designed to respond to both women’s and men’s needs and consider their roles in family agriculture,” she explains, “they will be in a stronger position to increase agricultural production and reduce rural poverty.” What is family farming? Family farming, or family agriculture, is a means of organizing agricultural, forestry, fisheries, pastoral and aquaculture production, which is managed and operated by a family and predominantly reliant on family labour, that of both women and men. The family and the farm are linked, co-evolve and combine economic, environmental, reproductive, social and cultural functions."

      "article_text": "More than 129 million child labourers in the world work in the agriculture sector, which includes fisheries, aquaculture, forestry and livestock. These girls and boys, between the ages of 5 and 17, are performing work that interferes with their education ©FAO/Alberto Conti Bernd Seiffert, FAO’s focal point for child labour in agriculture, explains what child labour means for girls and boys in the fisheries and aquaculture sector and how it can be eliminated. What are some of the tasks boys and girls undertake in fisheries that can be labelled ‘child labour’? According to the ILO, fishing at sea is probably the most dangerous occupation in the world. The type of work boys and girls do varies from situation to situation but, in general, boys are more often involved in fishing out at sea on fishing vessels. Some of the dangers are night fishing and diving, where children run the risk of drowning and other injuries. Girls are more often involved in processing fish, frequently being exposed, for example, to smoke inhalation. Boys and girls help build fishing boats, and this often exposes them to dust, sawdust, chemicals and loud noises, not to mention the fact that they also use dangerous tools. What are some of the consequences for boys and girls working as child labourers? Exposure to hazards on the job can lead to injuries, physical exhaustion and diseases. Child labourers can also experience harassment and violence. All this can result in permanent disabilities or psychological damage. Some health problems or disabilities appear later in life. For example, children who carry heavy loads often develop musculoskeletal problems in adulthood, others exposed to toxic chemicals develop cancer. Besides the physical and psychological effects, men and women who worked as child labourers have a low probability of finding decent work. Their limited education prevents them from getting decent wage jobs as adults. For example, interviews with young fishermen at Lake Malawi found that several who had started working on boats as young water bailers without finishing primary school education, later wanted to work on the business side of the sector but couldn’t since they weren’t able to read or write. The consequences of little or no education are dire for boys and girls. We know that girls’ education has a direct impact on nutrition and health outcomes and can over time decrease infant, child and maternal mortality rates. Education can also help to protect against HIV and AIDS. Are there statistics on child labour in fisheries? We know that sixty percent of the world’s child labourers work in agriculture as a whole, but a breakdown by subsector is not available, though badly needed so policy makers can take informed decisions. Why are parents sending their sons and daughters to work in this sector? There are many reasons, depending on the specific context, but the main one is poverty. Some parents rely on the entire family’s help to meet their basic needs. Fisheries and aquaculture are attractive sectors, as they offer a chance to make quick money. Another reason is cultural attitudes in remote fishing communities. In many communities, there is a low level of awareness of what constitutes child labour as opposed to legally acceptable work. In some cases, the quality of education may not be seen as relevant and useful and in other cases there may be no schools or parents may not be able to afford the cost of schooling. What is FAO doing to improve the situation? FAO and ILO have supported government officials, agricultural and other organizations in Malawi, for example, to develop a rich national framework for action to end child labour in agriculture, which includes fisheries. The framework for action is a strategy that calls for various ministries and civil society groups to each do their part in eliminating the root causes and to take up preventive measures to end child labour. For example, it calls for improvements in the agricultural sector to reduce the demand for child labour - decent working conditions and wages for workers, the sustainable management of natural resources and more labour-saving technologies. It urges more investments in education, school feeding programmes and other incentives, so parents can send their sons and daughters to school. The strategy also reaches the grassroots level, pressing local communities to take part in child labour monitoring systems and spread the word about the harm caused by young children working in hazardous conditions. In Cambodia, where a lot of families struggle to obtain enough food and money to send their children to school, FAO and ILO supported the development of a strategy to end child labour in fisheries and training of Fisheries Administration officials. Essentially, Cambodia is trying to eliminate what’s driving children into hazardous fisheries work and what’s causing fisheries to use inexpensive labour. They decided to include child labour concerns in the 10-year Strategic Planning Framework for Fisheries and the Cambodia Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and other laws and policies. The Community Fisheries organizations themselves are reinforcing Cambodia’s strategy to eliminate child labour in the sector. In their plans to ensure that small-scale fisherfolk can make a decent living in the future, they call for creating a community fisheries fund that includes the prevention of child labour as one of the criteria for determining who can borrow money. What needs to be done to end child labour? Child labour can only end if government officials, development partners, the private sector, fishers’ organizations and fishing communities work together. The issues of poverty, food security and child labour must all be addressed through coherent policies that are socially and environmentally sustainable. Preventing child labour entails enabling girls and boys to attend school and grow up healthy with good work prospects. Parents and fishers have to understand the dangers and the potential damage such work can do to children, the sector, the environment and the economy. That way, local communities can work with governments to choose and apply solutions that best respond to their needs. To this end, FAO and ILO have produced a publication, “ Guidance on addressing child labour in fisheries and aquaculture ,” explaining how to prevent, protect and withdraw girls and boys from child labour."

The women said they were playing a stronger role in household decision-making and community initiatives. FAO conducted the studies to analyze how land-related investments in agriculture affected women’s and men’s employment and earning opportunities as well as their access, control and use of land in three African countries and a fourth in southeast Asia. In Northern Tanzania, for example, a horticulture company in Arusha took measures to increase women’s participation. It ensured that women could join as outgrowers by establishing individual contracts for both men and women. The company’s efforts also included extending social security, healthcare and maternity leave benefits to permanent women employees and promoting women to management positions. Similarly, a company that produces mangoes in northern Ghana issued individual contracts to any member of the same family who wanted to participate as an outgrower. Thus, a woman could join the scheme even if her husband was already a member. In two communities, located in Geshiegu-Karaga District, more opportunities were created for women to join the scheme when the chiefs made considerable areas of land available for mango cultivation to any community member. Traditionally, men are reluctant to grant women access to land for tree cultivation for fear that they may claim rights over the trees and the land on which they are grown. In Zambia, a sugar cane-producing company that had mostly male outgrowers decided to increase the number of female outgrowers. To do so, it allowed widows to take over their deceased husbands’ contracts. These women felt that by having their names on the contracts and being the outgrowers themselves they had challenged negative attitudes about their capabilities and rights. The women also felt that this has helped them to better articulate their problems and identify solutions when necessary. “Giving jobs to young women, especially from poorer households and ethnic minorities with little or no access to land, on a banana plantation in Lao PDR made a big difference in their livelihoods,” says Martha Osorio, FAO Gender and Rural Development Officer. The company employing them created opportunities for women to be promoted to supervisory roles with accompanying pay rises. In all of these examples, the measures taken helped promote women’s economic empowerment. Conversely, when companies did not proactively support women’s involvement, the land-based investments in agriculture presented several challenges: Women were often left out of the consultations and negotiations with investors over the terms of inclusion in the companies. As a result, they did not receive monetary or land compensation from the private investors. In some cases, communal and forest areas were allocated to investors, causing women to lose access to land where they collected fuelwood, medicinal plants and other non-timber forest products that were essential to their income and food supply. The wives of outgrowers experienced a large increase in workload when they had to tend to a new crop in addition to those for which they were traditionally responsible. Despite the additional work, the women did not benefit directly from the extra income because their names were not on the outgrower contracts. The four studies are part of a larger FAO programme which seeks to generate knowledge and raise awareness on the consequences for men and women of land-related agricultural investments. From these findings, recommendations have been drawn for policy makers and investors to better take women’s and men’s needs and priorities into account in agriculture and investment policies, strategies and programmes."

But accessing this scarce resource can be difficult for those engaged in rural agriculture, women in pa ©FAO/Rodger Bosch Despite female farmers’ knowledge of crop production, local biodiversity, soils and local water resources, they are frequently not perceived as farmers by planners, engineers, extension staff and policy makers and thus tend to be excluded from making decisions about new agricultural water management systems. Yet, when women have the same decision-making power as men in irrigation, rainwater harvesting, flood control and watershed management, agricultural production can be greatly enhanced. Designing effective, efficient, equitable and sustainable agricultural water systems is the focus of a publication written by FAO Gender and Development Officer Ilaria Sisto, Deputy Director of Gender and Water Alliance Esther de Jong and International Water Management and Gender Consultant and GEWAMED Project Manager Juan Antonio Sagardoy. Sisto explains why the booklet is important; “ Passport to mainstreaming gender in water programmes: key questions for interventions in the agricultural sector ” can serve as a conduit for improving women’s access to an essential resource and rural people’s livelihoods. How can the same access to water for women and men make a difference in agriculture? When women have equal access to productive resources and services they can increase the yields on their farms, which raises the agricultural output and reduces hunger in the world. This will also bring economic and social gains not only for women but also for households, communities and society. Women represent 43 percent of the agricultural labour force in developing countries -- yet their work is not always recognized by planners, engineers, extension staff and decision-makers. In many parts of the world women, compared to men, operate smaller farms, have fewer livestock and spend more time on household chores, such as fetching water. In Guinea, for example, women spend more than twice as much time fetching water and wood per week than men and in Malawi over eight times more. Women face disadvantages in many countries where they have less access than men to education, agricultural information and extension services, technology and financial services. What is the purpose of this publication? To improve the effectiveness of water management projects and systems, while strengthening the position of rural women or other disadvantaged groups. Experience has shown that projects designed and implemented with the full participation of women are more sustainable and effective. The ‘ passport ’ is designed to help water professionals determine the needs of men and women and how they can take part in making decisions on the types of services, location of facilities and operation and maintenance of irrigation systems. It helps identify the problems that pertain to women and men and any disparities between them during the planning, implementation and monitoring of projects or programmes and to formulate solutions. What does mainstreaming gender in water programmes mean? It is when water projects, programmes and policies take into account the knowledge, needs and requirements of men, women, boys and girls of different ages, class and social-economic status. By involving both women and men in decision-making in agricultural water management, their sense of ownership and their access and control over water services will increase through improved legislation and making programmes more efficient, effective and sustainable. Who will benefit from using this publication? This booklet was developed for field staff involved in water management projects. It is in pocket format, so that professionals, practitioners and technicians can easily carry it with them. The ultimate beneficiaries are women and men in rural areas who will profit from equal and efficient water distribution, leading to higher yields, improved food security and poverty reduction. How should the ‘passport’ be used? Why a list of questions? The passport focuses on six key issues related to water programmes for agriculture: 1) access to land and water, 2) farming context, 3) multiple use of water, 4) management of irrigation systems, 5) water distribution, irrigation practices and maintenance, and 6) other environmental issues, with specific questions to guide the users in addressing the gender aspects. Answering and adapting the questions will help identify areas where efforts are needed to make the project more gender sensitive, so that they even out any inequalities between women and men. The checklists can also be used to prepare a survey questionnaire for local communities. Its guiding principles are that the different roles that women and men play are key to understanding the livelihoods of rural people. It recognizes that marginalized men and women are a priority and their participation in planning, implementing, monitoring and evaluating development activities is essential. What is unique about this publication, does it fill a gap? Yes, we wanted to assist water professionals in assessing the needs of the men and women who will manage the water. Until recently the focus of many agricultural water management projects and programmes was on technical issues, but it has since become clear that projects are more successful when the potential users are involved in the planning, implementation and monitoring. Additionally, this passport will facilitate the identification of priorities and in determining what investments are needed. It will also assist in identifying possible conflicts over scarce water resources among different socio-economic and ethnic groups and in foreseeing other problems so they may be prevented or addressed. We hope that by using this publication there will be more effective, efficient, equitable and sustainable water management in agriculture. Is there anything you would like to add? This booklet is an important contribution to FAO’s commitment to reducing gender and social inequalities in the water sector. As stated in our Policy on Gender Equality , we need to achieve equality among men and women in sustainable agricultural production and rural development for the elimination of hunger and poverty. This means striving to achieve equal voice and access for women and men to productive resources and services."

Agroforestry activities are often gender-differentiated: while men are usually interested in trees and forests for commercial purposes, women tend to favour subsistence benefits -- food, fuelwood, fodder and soil fertility improvement. A review of 104 studies of gender and agroforestry in Africa, cited in the paper, affirms that women’s participation is very high in the production and processing of indigenous fruit and vegetable products. “Women’s knowledge is often critical for household survival, but is rarely recognized in forest management plans,” Stloukal explains. In many parts of the world, women’s forestry and agroforestry activities are less lucrative than those of men. Tree products such as charcoal, logs, timber, large branches and poles are often considered male domains and in places like the Luo and Luhya communities in western Kenya, women are restricted from harvesting high-value timber trees. “When policy makers and service providers recognize the value of women’s roles in forestry value chains -- as we’ve seen with initiatives involving shea nut butter in Burkina Faso and gum karaya in India -- their incomes can be raised significantly,” says Stloukal. A number of interrelated cultural, socio-economic and institutional reasons are causing the differences between men’s and women’s opportunities in the forestry sector. They range from the social perceptions of women’s roles and the time women have to spend on domestic responsibilities and childcare to gender disparities in literacy, education, physical abilities, technical skills and access to training and credit services. Women must not only be represented in forestry institutions, but also accepted as stakeholders with specific views and interests, the FAO paper contends. Empowerment of women through, for example, formal education, training and support for income generation would allow them to have a greater say in transformative decisions. “Efforts to include women in forest-related institutions should be strengthened,” says Stloukal, “because women can help maximize synergies between the forest sector and food security for the benefit of all.”"

      "article_text": "Government leaders and world food experts called for a ‘global goal on food and nutrition security’ in the Post-2015 development agenda during a high-level consultation on Hunger, Food Security and Nutrition in Madrid, Spain, on 4 April 2013. Handing thei ©FAO/Olivier Asselin FAO Deputy Director for Gender, Equity and Rural Employment Eve Crowley, who represents the organization in the Post-2015 Development Framework discussions, explains why food security and gender should be top priorities in the global plan that succeeds the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The deadline for theMDGs is soon here, what needs to be done? We have 1,000 days from the Post-2015 Development Framework meeting in Madrid to achieve the MDGs, which is the same amount of time at the beginning of a human’s life to ensure adequate nutrition and food security, without which we have stunted children, humans who have greater difficulties to live, learn or prosper. At the same time almost 870 million people remain undernourished in 2010-12; a number of hungry people which remains still unacceptably and embarrassingly high. How can we build on the MDG experience in the UN’s vision for a post-2015 strategy? The MDGs were very valuable and important as a catalyst to encourage governments and the development community to focus their support on key areas of human development and poverty reduction. They brought a broad set of people around a focused agenda. The Post-2015 development framework, like the MDGs, should be simple, transparent, measurable and easy to communicate. How should gender feature? There is really a need to address the underlying social issues more fully. Before gender equality was a separate goal and only had a one target (on education) and three indicators within it. This time around there’s debate about whether gender equality needs to be a strong cross-cutting theme central in all goals with specific targets and indicators for each and every one or whether a separate goal either to reduce inequalities generally or related to gender equality specifically is still needed. Many feel that the best option would be a combination of both, given that some issues, like violence against women or representation in political decision-making, would only be resolved through a focused gender equality goal and are unlikely to be adequately addressed under any of the other themes. In addition, we should think more about marginalized population groups – not only women but indigenous peoples and others. Bringing the perspectives of indigenous peoples into the picture, for example, can help us think about other dimensions of poverty beyond income, and other meanings of food security beyond caloric intake. What should the Post-2015 development framework include that the Millennium Development Goals did not to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of women? There are substantive areas that the MDGs did not touch on at all - energy, water and land rights, to give some examples. In the area of gender, one of the issues that has grown a lot in the last few years is that of violence against women as a dimension that underpins other gender-related opportunities and freedoms and which, some estimate, affects 75 percent of women. Violence undermines women’s economic and political empowerment. Without gender-related physical security, you can’t realize any of the other objectives. That has to be addressed when promoting gender equality. A target to increase women’s access to and control over property, including land rights, will also be fundamental for improving gender equality and human well-being across the board, as these assets support poverty reduction, food security, decent employment, resilience to disasters and environmental improvement. Why should strategies for a durable end to hunger, food insecurity and malnutrition include gender equality and women’s empowerment? Gender equality is a cornerstone to development, like food security is. Gender equality is fundamental for tapping into the full potential that humanity has to offer. There is a mountain of evidence that shows that greater gender equality can increase the nutritional, educational and health status of households, and can increase labour productivity and food production. Given this evidence, it would be simply foolish to ignore it. And from a rights perspective, whether we’re talking about food security, health, education, labour force, environment, inequalities between men and women are simply unacceptable and a major impediment to any framework for development that aims to be sustainable, irreversible, transformative and universal. A transformational agenda means that the system is set up in a way that both women and men can realize their full potential. What are some key dimensions of a gender-equitable vision of food security? There are three building blocks to achieve this vision: sustainable and resilient food production and consumption, good nutrition for all and focusing on agents of transformation. Who are they? These are the women and men small producers and their organizations, family farmers, fishers, livestock keepers, forest users, small entrepreneurs, workers, consumers, indigenous peoples and youth. We must invest in them and help ensure that they have equal access to assets, resources and opportunities, equal access to nutritious food - especially for pregnant women and children in poor countries, equal knowledge and skills including to reduce waste of water, soil, energy and food, and equal voice in the decision-making that influences social, economic and environmental well-being. Who should take action? Everyone, especially through enlightened partnerships. Governments play a particularly important role in guaranteeing rights and fair rules of the game and they need to move beyond political commitment to real leadership and accountability on these issues. In the realm of food security, we’re seeing a move away from the public-private dichotomy toward multi-stakeholder platforms, where many different people have a voice. We encourage everyone to get involved so that the Post-2015 agenda will move the world to a new basis for well-being within countries, between countries and across generations."

Gangale “Women, Violence and Food Security” The Executive Director of WFP, Ertharin Cousin, provided opening remarks that highlighted the importance of women's rights not only in the context of basic human rights but as a means to combat hunger. Fernanda Guerrieri, FAO Directeur de Cabinet followed with examples of how gender inequalities in access to, utilization of, and control over productive resources and opportunities reduce women’s autonomy and their capacity to act, which in turn increases their vulnerability to various forms of violence. A video montage of stories from each of the participating agencies and organizations showcased key projects and inititiatives, including WFP's SAFE stoves project in Darfur, Sudan; FAO's Junior Farmer Field and Life Schools initiative in the Kakuma Refugee Camp in Kenya; IFAD's work with Family Development Centers in Burundi; and IDLO's role in grassroots legal empowerment in countries such as Afghanistan, Morocco and Mozambique. A panel discussion, moderated by Francesca Caferri of La Repubblica, featured Irene Khan, Director General of the International Development Law Organization headquartered in Rome; Juvenal Jeremias Rwegasira of the Women’s Legal Aid Centre in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania; and Lourdes Tiban, Assembly Member of the Legislative Body of Ecuador. The panelists cited the role of education, empowerment (including economic, legal and political empowerment), food and income security, and resilience in ensuring increased knowledge, skills, and opportunities for women and girls, and in reducing their vulnerability to violence. In responding to questions from the floor, the panelists touched on ways in which food security and violence against women are inextricably linked, particularly in the context of gender-based violence as a coping strategy for hunger. They also underscored the importance of a rights-based approach in creating a \"culture of justice.\" The rights-based approach was further discussed in the context of global development as a whole: Ms Khan noted that the emphasis on rights had been “rather subdued” during the process for the Millennium Development Goals, which were more focused on indicators, and hoped that work on the Post-2015 Development Agenda would incorporate more of a rights-based approach.

Ecuador : Mr Pedro Pablo Peña, FAO Representative, Ecuador, participated in a press conference on the subject of women, food sovereignty, and family farming. In collaboration with WFP, FAO Ecuador is also organizing several photo exhibitions on the theme of rural women, the first of which will be held in the province of Sucumbíos from 11 to 22 March 2013. Peru : FAO participated in various events commemorating International Women's Day, in particular \"Woman: keeper of biodiversity\" organized by the Ministry of Culture. Attendees included FAO Representative Peru Mr John Preissing and First Lady Nadine Heredia Alarcón de Humala of Peru, who is also an FAO Special Ambassador for the International Year of Quinoa. Latin America and the Caribbean : To help raise awareness on the linkages between hunger, violence and poverty, the Gender Team in FAO's Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean developed special commemorative cards in the four working languages of our region (Spanish, English Portuguese and French), for distribution to FAO Representations, Subregional Offices, and other key counterparts and stakeholders across the region."

      "article_text": "Rural cooperatives and farmers’ organizations play a crucial role in the eradication of hunger and poverty. One of the ways they achieve this is through their vocation to empower small agricultural producers, and in particular women farmers. © FAO/F. Branquinho “Organizing is the key to empowerment. Organizing is the process by which people who are individually weak and vulnerable unite and create power together. When individuals who are among the poorest, least educated and most disenfranchised members of society come together they experience dramatic changes in their lives.” -- Renana Jhabvala, Self-Employed Women's Association (SEWA). Empowering women farmers improves food security for all Women comprise on average 43% of the agricultural labour force in developing countries and produce the bulk of the world’s food crops. While the vast majority of small scale producers experience difficulties accessing resources, socio-cultural norms particularly curtail women producer’s access to productive resources including education, land, technologies, information, financial services, and markets. Their presence in decision-making bodies, especially in leadership positions, also remains weak, and their needs as farmers are seldom accounted for in policy and resource allocation. As a result, women farmers do not produce to their full capacity. If women farmers had access to the same opportunities and resources as men farmers, their productivity would rise significantly and the food security of millions of people would be improved. One challenge that remains is to improve women’s participation in cooperatives. 1 The same socio-economic constraints that limit women’s access to resources also often challenge their participation in organizations. 2012, declared the International Year of Cooperatives by the United Nations General Assembly, offers a unique window of opportunity for governments and development agencies to reinforce farmers’ organizations and to support them to empower the women within their ranks. How cooperatives and farmers’ organizations work for women producers Through the power of association, cooperatives and farmers’ organizations have long demonstrated their capacity to help small scale producers overcome barriers to gain better access to resources and inputs, and thus to play a greater role in meeting the growing global food demand. For women producers, who are at a greater disadvantage, cooperatives offer networks of mutual support and solidarity that allow them to grow their social capital, improve their self-esteem and self-reliance, acquire a greater voice in decision-making, and collectively negotiate better contract terms, prices and access to a wide range of resources and services including: agricultural resources and assets; markets to commercialize their produce; credit, capital and other financial services; and social services. Numerous examples from around the world demonstrate how women producers are socially and economically empowered through their membership in cooperatives and farmers’ organizations, allowing them to produce more, earn better incomes, and raise the living standards and economic and food security of their families and communities. As part of the FAO Agricultural Commodities Project, the Exposure and Exchange Programme (EEP), one of FAO’s initiatives to support women producers, brings together women leaders from the Self-Employed Women’s Association (SEWA), a highly successful network of partner organizations that has over 1.24 million women members across India, 54% of whom are agricultural workers, and from producer organizations from other part of the world to exchange ideas and improve their organizations’ operations. The EEP held in 2011 brought together women leaders from SEWA and from producer organizations from West and Central Africa. Many examples of women farmers’ improved productivity were evoked during the meeting. One of them is the experience of the members of the small Benkadi women’s cooperative of shallots producers in the Segou region of Mali. Members were experiencing difficulties getting a good price for their produce and as a result were unable to invest and expand their production. By reaching out and coming together with 21 other small associations of women shallot producers, they were able to integrate the larger Faso Jigi farmers’ cooperative. Faso Jigi invested in 19 shallot storage facilities and marketed the produce where prices were more advantageous, offering the women a better income and the opportunity to invest in their businesses and expand their production. Currently, 920 of the Faso Jigi’s 4 200 members are women shallot producers whose needs and concerns are taken into account in the cooperative’s operations. Reinforcing women’s participation and leadership 2012, the International Year of Cooperatives, offers a unique opportunity for the international community to address the challenge of improving women’s access and leadership within cooperatives to empower them to improve their lives and that of their families’ and communities’, and to support better global food security. Many effective measures can be adopted by governments, international organizations and cooperatives themselves to achieve this. To this end, a range of recommendations were put forward at the Expert Group Meeting “Enabling rural women's economic empowerment: institutions, opportunities and participation” held by UN Women and the Rome-based UN agencies--FAO, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) and the World Food Programme (WFP)--in September 2011 in Accra, Ghana. At the macro and policy level, the measures that governments can adopt include creating legislation and regulatory frameworks that ensure farmers’ organizations can operate independently and offer incentives for rural women to join, reserving spaces for women farmer leaders to participate in country and global policy processes, and institutionalizing mechanisms to involve leaders of women farmers’ organizations in agricultural and rural policy making. Cooperatives can also be supported to establish quotas for the participation of women in their leadership and to create women-only committees to ensure they can voice their concerns strongly enough to exercise leadership; conduct training activities to sensitize cooperative members to the negative impact of gender inequalities in the home, farm/workplace, and in society as a whole; and to implement training programs that improve women farmers’ access to agricultural technologies and allow them to develop their skills. Through their ability to reach marginalized groups, to empower their members economically and socially, and to create sustainable rural employment through equitable business models, cooperatives and farmers’ organizations comprise unique platforms to provide women producers with the means to better contribute to global food security. By strengthening support to these organizations and facilitating women’s membership, the international community will accomplish great strides towards the eradication of hunger. ----------------------------- 1 .

      "article_text": "On the heels of the 2012 International AIDS Conference, which took place from July 22-27 in Washington DC, we sat down with Karine Garnier, FAO’s Nairobi-based regional emergency officer for gender and HIV. © FAO/R. Gangale Karine Garnier, FAO Regional Emergency Officer for Gender and HIV in Nairobi, manages a regional project supporting people affected by HIV and gender inequities, including gender-based violence, in six countries in East and Central Africa and was among the nearly 24,000 delegates from around the world attending the 2012 International AIDS Conference in Washington DC. At the conference, Karine participated in a meeting on the importance and challenges of addressing HIV in humanitarian emergencies, giving a presentation, along with colleagues from the World Food Programme (WFP), on the integration of HIV into the crisis response in the Horn of Africa. What are some of the particular challenges related to HIV in emergencies? In an emergency context, the risk factors for HIV infection increase. Displacement, transactional sex, which increases when people find themselves in desperate situations, sexual and gender-based violence, rape – all of these factors that put people at greater risk of infection tend to be more prevalent in emergency situations. In addition, food insecurity and malnutrition can accelerate the development of the virus in those infected with HIV, and leave others, whose immune systems are weak due to malnutrition, more vulnerable to infection. In emergencies, as in the general HIV response, we need to have all sectors integrating HIV concerns into their interventions. The global inter-agency task team of UN and non-UN agencies working on emergencies and HIV helps ensure that we act in an integrated, coordinated way to address the issue following guidelines on HIV developed by the humanitarian community. Can you talk a bit about the project you are managing to address some of these issues in East and Central Africa? The project is funded by the Swedish International Development Agency and targets six countries in the region – Burundi, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Rwanda and Uganda. We help rural populations affected by HIV and gender inequalities improve their livelihoods and their nutrition through training sessions and using the junior and adult Farmer Field and Life School methodology, where groups of male and female farmers learn through observation and experimentation in their own fields and communities. So far, the project has reached 80,000 men, women and children with a curriculum aimed at increasing awareness of gender issues, reducing the stigma of HIV and improving nutrition levels and food security. For people living with HIV, nutrition is a crucial element of living well. Without good nutrition, even people receiving anti-retroviral treatment will do poorly. Often, eating well is a challenge due to economic constraints but also due to lack of knowledge of what is nutritionally good to eat. So we ensure that we provide training on good nutrition – what to eat, how to prepare it – focusing mainly on what they produce, what is available locally. What are some of the impacts you’ve seen so far? An important impact has been the empowerment of previously marginalized people. The beneficiaries of the project are being reintegrated into their communities because now, as a result of the training they have received, they are seen as productive members of the society. They are more active in the community, more inclined to assume leadership positions, and when it comes to young people, they are more keen to go back to school if they have dropped out, or to improve their school performance. Field school participants receive agriculture know-how and inputs to improve the productivity of their farms. They have improved their incomes through the sale of surplus production and their nutrition through consumption of the food they have produced. They become self-reliant. Also, because it's group based, we’ve seen a reduction in stigma related to HIV and in discrimination against victims of gender-based violence. This comes from their being perceived as productive members of society. As a result of the training we do on HIV, there is also greater understanding of what HIV is, which helps demystify some of the taboos. We’ve even seen some successful examples of groups forming cooperatives. So the group-based approach is very important because it's what will help sustain the intervention in the future. At national level there is much more recognition of the field school approach as a successful methodology for technology transfer. In some countries there has even been interest in incorporating the field school methodology into national curricula. Are the men on board with the gender elements of the project? Our approach helps empower women but in a manner that doesn't threaten men. Men are actively involved so they see the benefits and don’t feel disempowered. Men have an important role to play in achieving gender equality. Focusing exclusively on women can, in some cases, create more harm than good. If the men in the community are excluded, they can feel disempowered and when the women go back to their households this can create tension. So it’s not only about women. Any plans for expansion? A recent external evaluation of the project recommended scaling up the intervention in the region, but in stronger partnership with other agencies. Discussion is under way within the regional network on gender and rural livelihoods, led by FAO, on how to do this. There is a lot of interest around it and demand from surrounding communities to start this sort of program. Some of our partners are already expanding this approach to other areas, and we have trained around 40 master trainers and 260 facilitators who are now fully equipped to train others, facilitate field schools and address HIV and gender issues. With these master trainers, we have created a wider capacity to do more. Also, because it’s a regional project, it includes exchange between countries, where trainees from one country visit another to learn and share their experiences. This helps us collect lessons learned within region, but also to share these beyond the current project countries. How did you get involved in working on HIV? In 2003, I was living in South Africa and working in a local clinic, assisting with an administration system. In South Africa, particularly in Johannesburg, where I was working, HIV is very prevalent and we had many HIV-positive patients. So I became interested, and received training in HIV counseling. When my family and I moved to Kenya, I continued working on HIV programs and was eventually hired first by WFP and then by FAO when they started their emergency program on gender and HIV. Does the project provide treatment to participants? We don’t provide treatment, but we make sure that we link up with the health system in the countries where we work so we can target the most vulnerable and connect them with existing services, ensure beneficiaries go to the clinic, encourage those who don’t know their status to go for testing and so on, which is part of the whole multi-sectoral approach. Some groups that we’ve worked with have actually gone as a group for testing. This happened in Kenya. A number of people tested positive, but when they told the group there was solidarity, not stigma. Because of the sense of cohesion from working together? Yes, because of the sense of trust within the group, the sense of empowerment. The project approach helps the farmers to be empowered in their fields, but also in their lives. In rural areas it’s not always easy to touch on subjects like HIV and gender inequity. A local official once told me, “When we call for a meeting on HIV, no one comes because there is so much stigma associated with it.” But in these projects, it’s easier because the issues are brought into the group. The farmers are there for their own economic benefit, but the social outcome is also very good."

      "article_text": "Granting secure land rights to vulnerable farmers enables them to pursue income-earning activities, access credit, increase agricultural production and raise their overall living conditions. These key factors help to strengthen men and women’s bargaining © FAO/G. Napolitano On 11 May 2012 the Committee on World Food Security (CFS) endorsed the Voluntary Guidelines on the Responsible Governance of Tenure of Land, Fisheries and Forests in the Context of National Food Security . The Guidelines outline principles and practices that Governments can adopt, when designing land-related strategies, to ensure equitable tenure rights for both women and men. They were developed through an extensive consultation process, started by FAO in 2009, which brought together members of governments, civil society organizations, nonprofits organizations, farmers' associations and the private sector. Granting secure land rights to vulnerable farmers enables them to pursue income-earning activities, access credit, increase agricultural production and raise their overall living conditions. These key factors help to strengthen men and women’s bargaining power and, consequently, their ability to make decisions on how their land can be used. Martha Osorio, FAO Gender and Rural Development Officer , explains why the adoption of the Guidelines represents an important achievement for women’s rights and for the realization of the right to food, particularly for marginalized groups. Why is it important to promote gender equality and women’s land, fisheries and forests tenure rights? Rural women play a crucial role in agriculture and in the management of natural resources. They are involved in both crop and livestock production at subsistence and commercial levels. They produce food and cash crops and manage different and complex agricultural systems, often managing crops, livestock and fish farming. In many regions, rural women are also highly knowledgeable on traditional agricultural and conservation practices, and on crop diversity. Recent figures show that globally women represent about 20 percent of landholders. Compared to men, female farmers in all regions also control less livestock, make far less use of improved seed varieties and purchased inputs, such as fertilizers. To promote food security and responsible governance of natural resources, the Guidelines needed to take into consideration men and women’s different access and use of agricultural inputs and resources; and push to include women in all land-related processes. Particular emphasis was given to national and local institutions concerned with administering land tenure and natural resources. How are women’s and gender issues addressed in the Guidelines? The process of consultation and negotiation that preceded the adoption of the Voluntary Guidelines demonstrated a great commitment to gender issues by the members and participants of the CFS, and also by the large number of practitioners and civil society members who were part of the process since the beginning. The Guidelines are unique because they represent the first global land tenure agreement, and they adopt a sustainable development model that directly responds to the needs of rural families and communities. Within this framework, gender equality is identified in the document as one of the 10 principles for the implementation of responsible tenure governance. In other words, the Guidelines underline that gender equality is at the core of all processes and aspects of tenure governance, including policy formulation, service provisioning, and access to legal systems and information. They also make special provisions to improve gender equality in both formal and customary systems, for instance, through amending discriminatory inheritance and property laws. From the onset, we worked actively to mainstream gender equality issues throughout the document. We believe that if the voluntary guidelines are implemented following the main principles outlined, men and women, through greater participation in land-related institutions and processes, will have greater and equitable access to land. What are some of the key issues that the Guidelines address in relation to gender equality and women’s empowerment? Women’s issues and perspectives are well articulated in the Guidelines. The Guidelines call upon Governments to fully remove inequalities in the law: both in property, family and succession laws, as well as in national agrarian laws. Among other issues, the guidelines address women's poor access to legal advice and representation; the occurrence of arbitrary evictions from their land; the need to safeguard the rights of women who hold subsidiary tenure rights, such as gathering rights. The guidelines also look at introducing legal reforms that strengthen women’s land rights, even when these come into contrast with customary tenure systems. What are some of the key recommendations put forward to promote and protect women's empowerment and gender equality? One of the key recommendations from the Voluntary Guidelines is for Governments to acknowledge the different roles, needs, challenges and priorities women and men have and to take specific measures to accelerate gender equality. This includes, for example, removing and prohibiting all forms of discrimination related to tenure rights, including those resulting from change of marital status, lack of legal capacity, and lack of access to economic resources. The Guidelines also actively encourage States to provide assistance and services that take into account women's needs and constraints; guarantee that land redistribution reforms provide equal access to land for men and women; and monitor the different impact public and private sector strategies have on male and female farmers, so that they benefit equally."

Naeem Marcela Villarreal, Director of FAO’s Gender, Equity and Rural Employment Division, talks about some of FAO’s recent efforts to promote action-oriented dialogue on rural women’s empowerment. What were some of the key issues you raised at the international conference on “Gender, Family and Peasant Farming”, which took place at the University of Toulouse II – Le Mirail and was designed to facilitate dialogue between academic, development and teaching worlds? 1 The rationale behind this conference was to investigate the links between family farming, community development and the environment by using a gender lens. More specifically, we were asked to propose innovative methods to address inequalities in various areas of focus, such as agricultural and environmental policies, or the management of natural resources. In this context, I looked at the importance of promoting gender equality within agricultural sector interventions and policies. We know from FAO’s latest State of Food and Agriculture report that governments, donors and development practitioners must be aware of the different impacts that policies can have on men and women – even when no explicit discrimination is intended. In many countries, women do not have the same rights as men - to buy, sell or inherit land, to open a savings account or borrow money, to sign a contract or sell their produce. So, while some policies are designed to help rural women achieve their full potential as producers and decision-makers, many more fall short of this task, and only acknowledge their reproductive roles as mothers and caregivers. To help move past this hurdle, I am proposing a framework that can help to determine the level of gender-sensitivity of agricultural policies. This tool, which will be published in the proceedings of the conference, should be particularly useful to policy-makers in adjusting national, regional or local policies, so that they respond better to gender equality goals and avoid detrimental impacts on women and men. At the OECD Forum 2012, the overarching theme was to find sustainable solutions to the economic and social challenges facing people around the world today. What key issues did you raise during the panel discussion on Feeding the world, sustaining the planet? 2 An interesting element of this panel discussion was the attention given to food loss and food waste. We know that, although enough food is being produced today to feed the global population, 925 million people still go to bed hungry every day. Feeding the world in 2050, when world population is expected to reach 9.1 billion people, will require us to make much better use of the food we produce, but it will also call for significant increases in overall food production – a target that must be achieved in environmentally sound and equitable ways. We know that one way of feeding the world sustainably from here to 2050, is by addressing gender inequalities in the agricultural sector. Our studies show that if women had the same access as men to key productive resources we could significantly increase agricultural production. This, in turn, could have a major impact on the reduction of world hunger. So what we must really focus on today, is revitalizing the agricultural sector, but also engaging people – youth, women and civil society groups – to ensure that producers and consumers throughout the food chain, including those who are vulnerable and food insecure, are effectively organized and represented in the policy process. During the P2P Study Tour on Women in Agriculture organized by the EU Commission and the Caritas Congress on Global Hunger and Sustainable Food Security you also discussed the important role that rural women play in agriculture. These themes are directly related to FAO’s work and mandate, so what do you hope participants took away from your interventions? 3 For many years the agricultural sector was neglected and, over time, this has contributed to increasingly high and volatile food prices, as well as scarce livelihood opportunities for rural people in the agricultural sector. But following the food price crisis, and the agriculture-focused World Development Report in 2008, international attention has finally turned a little more towards agriculture and rural areas. In this context of renewed interest, we need to intensify our efforts to highlight rural women’s issues. One of the best investments we can make is in building the human capital of women and girls – education, information and extension services are essential building blocks for agricultural productivity and economic growth. Last February, the 56th session of the Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) focused its priority theme on the empowerment of rural women and their role in poverty and hunger eradication. This has created a great political opening and - I hope - an opportunity for governments to truly recognize that rural women’s participation is needed to shape responses to development challenges."

Napolitano The UN Inter-Agency Task Force on Rural Women (IANWGE) recently estimated that rural women and girls still fare worse than rural men and urban women in relation to every Millennium Development Goal indicator . The fight against hunger and poverty is most pressing in rural areas where most of the world’s poor live. Women play an important role in rural economies, particularly in agriculture, where they make up 43 percent of the agricultural labour force of developing countries. However, they face a range of constraints, particularly in accessing productive resources such a land, inputs, training and credit that prevent them from realizing their full potential, creating better lives for themselves and their families, and fully contributing to the growth of their communities An untapped motor of growth and food security As the UN organizations most directly responsible for achieving a world without hunger, the Rome-based UN agencies (RBAs)—FAO, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), and the World Food Programme (WFP)--actively work towards rural women’s social and economic empowerment as a motor of poverty reduction and better food security. As such, the RBAs played a major role in the 56th session of The Commission on the Status of Women (CSW) , the principal global policy-making body committed to gender equality and the advancement of women, which was held earlier this month and focused on rural women and their role in development, poverty reduction and food security. Ann Tutwiler, FAO Deputy Director-General, spoke on behalf of the RBAs at CSW’s opening session, explaining that the findings of the last edition of FAO’s flagship report— The State of Food and Agriculture 2011 (SOFA) -- had set two concrete goals in the fight against hunger: improve the agricultural sector in developing countries to feed a rapidly growing global population, and generate more and better rural employment to give people the means to acquire this food--neither achievable without rural women’s empowerment. “The SOFA shows that by giving women equal access to productive agricultural resources—land, inputs, training, credit—women’s farm productivity would increase by 20-30%, countries’ total agricultural output would increase by 2.5-4.0% and 100-150 million fewer would be hungry,” Ms. Tutwiler explained. “Essentially, the SOFA says that because rural women’s economic potential is squandered, 100 to 150 million people are still hungry and a significant share of agricultural production is ‘missing.’ “ She explained that while the international community’s work has made inroads, particularly in filling critical knowledge gaps on gender and land rights, rural employment and agriculture, progress is still needed with regards to policies for agriculture and rural development that benefit rural men and women more equally, legal frameworks that grant women full economic rights, better access to education, training, information and technologies, health care and nutrition, and a stronger and more meaningful participation of women in decision making processes. The RBAs focused their participation on three priority themes: improving rural women’s economic empowerment and access to decent rural employment, supporting associations in giving them a stronger voice in decision-making, and fostering their better access to land rights. A need for greater economic empowerment and better access to decent work In partnership with IFAD, WFP, UN Women and The International Labor Organization (ILO), FAO organized two side events to discuss the urgency of improving rural women’s economic empowerment and of supporting their better access to decent employment to fight poverty and hunger. Women fulfill many crucial roles in rural economies, as farmers--they comprise 43 per cent of the agricultural labour force in developing countries—and as workers and small-scale entrepreneurs, but their productivity is persistently limited by gender inequalities. They are more likely than men to hold low-wage, part-time, seasonal employment and tend to be paid less even when their qualifications are higher than men’s. They are also disproportionately responsible for taking care of the household, raising children and caring for the sick and elderly, unpaid work most often performed without the support of infrastructure and technologies. Improved gender equality in rural farm and non-farm employment has a long lasting impact on economic growth and poverty reduction by enabling rural women to contribute to their families' livelihoods, improve their households' resilience to shocks and enhance the well-being of their children. Participants discussed the type of policies needed for rural women’s economic empowerment. These include increased government investment in labour-saving technologies and public infrastructure such as roads, transport, electricity and water; supporting rural women and girls’ better access to human capital through education and training; the establishment of social safety nets like health care insurance and socials services such as child care; the creation of a better investment climate by strengthening property rights, including land rights; and supporting rural women’s greater voice in decision making. Cooperatives: Giving women a greater voice in the community This last item was the focus of the side event “Unleashing Rural Women’s Voice to End Hunger and Poverty” organized by FAO in partnership with IFAD, WFP, ILO, the World Bank and UN DESA. Moderated by Cheryl Morden, Director of IFAD’s North America Liaison Office, the event brought together leaders and members from rural and agricultural organizations and ministries worldwide including Marcela Villarreal, Director of FAO’s Gender and Rural Employment Division, Ann Itto, Secretary General of the Southern Sector of the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement and former Minister of Agriculture of South Sudan, Dr. Muchena, Minister of Women’s Affairs of Zimbabwe, Filomena Delgado from the Ministry of Agriculture of Angola, Elizabeth Atangana, President of the Plateforme Regionale des Organisations Paysannes d’Afrique Centrale (PROPAC), Rehana Riyalawala, Secretary of the Self-Employed Women’s Association in India (SEWA), Robert Carlson, President of the World Farmers’ Organization, and Rose Cunningham-Kain Director of the indigenous women’s organization Wangki Tangni in Nicaragua. All participants underlined the central role organizations and cooperatives play in supporting rural women’s participation and decision making in rural societies and enterprises by encouraging the facilitation and sharing of knowledge, and by reducing costs and barriers to accessing productive resources through collective bargaining. Mr. Carlson added that these organizations were unique in their provision of much-needed spaces for women to speak freely. Ms. Itto discussed women’s increased chances of attracting investors when organized in cooperatives and gave the example of Colombia, where 91% of microcredit is given through cooperatives. Ms. Riyalawala presented the model of SEWA, which, with over 1.4 million poor, self employed women members, is the largest union of informal sector workers in India and has been highly instrumental in bettering its members’ lives and improving their productivity by giving them the means to organize and to gain access to social security services, training, technology, information and financial services. Securing better land rights for women improves life for everyone Land is one of the most important assets for small agricultural producers. Women farmers are disadvantaged by the worldwide prevalence of land tenure regimes that allocate primary land rights to men through gender-biased marital and inheritance laws, family and community norms, their limited capacity to participate in community decision-making processes, and their unequal access to land markets. The land that women do own also tends to be of lesser quality. This considerably limits women farmer’s ability to invest in their land and improve their productivity, exacerbates their exposure to food insecurity and leaves them disproportionately vulnerable to economic hardships. A vast body of research shows that improving women’s land rights strengthens their bargaining power within the household, leading to better health and education outcomes for their children and significant benefits for households and communities in terms of production and wealth distribution. FAO, IFAD and the International Land Coalition (ILC) organized a side event to discuss interventions to reduce the gap in land rights. These include supporting legal reforms and joint titling and land certification programmes, supporting the increased representation of women in land administration bodies and facilitating legal literacy programmes for rural women. Participants insisted on the fact that strengthening women’s land rights is a matter of not just reforming land laws but that gender equity in land rights need to be upheld consistently across the entire legal framework, from the Constitution to family and civil laws, and supported by legal trainings enabling women to understand and claim their rights. They also underlined the importance of addressing customary norms and practices in parallel to official legal frameworks, and cited the state, civil society and the international community as key actors."

A guest post by FAO Deputy Director-General for Knowledge Ann Tutwiler When Alice Kachere, a small farmer from Malawi, lost her husband, she also lost her land, her home, and the means of providing for her three young children – all due to a lack of joint tenancy and land inheritance rights. For Cesarie Kantarama from Rwanda, access to credit and markets is the missing link to improving incomes for her and other small producers. Women farmers working their small plots can’t compete with high-quality less-expensive imports, she says, and live a precarious existence while middlemen benefit from the fruits of their labor. Indian farmer Sarala Gopalan says that women do most of the dirty agricultural work in her community, but only men, as the landholders, are considered farmers. For Sarala, tools that reduce women’s drudgery, help them work more efficiently and free up their time for more rewarding and remunerative activities will ensure that communities like hers do not waste half their human potential. I met Alice, Cesarie and Sarala during the UN Commission on the Status of Women’s recent meeting in New York. For the first time in the Commission’s 56 years, rural women were front and center, gathering from around the world to discuss the real challenges they face and to share ideas for overcoming them. Rural women play a critical role in the development and well-being of their communities, contributing to agriculture and rural enterprises that fuel local and global economies. Yet their economic potential is squandered due to the gender gap in access to productive resources and opportunities. According to FAO’s most recent State of Food and Agriculture report, just giving women the same access as men to modern seeds, fertilizer and tools could increase production on women’s farms in developing countries by 20 to 30 percent – enough to feed up to 150 million more of the world’s hungry people. Women make up, on average, 43 percent of the agricultural labour force in developing countries. But less than 20 percent of agricultural landholders worldwide are women due to legal and cultural constraints in land inheritance, ownership and use. Women represent less than 5 percent of all agricultural landholders in North Africa and West Asia, while across sub-Saharan Africa, they make up on average 15 percent. FAO estimates that feeding a global population of just over 9 billion in 2050 will require a 60 percent increase in global food production. Three-fourths of that production will need to come from developing countries. But producing more food is not enough, if poor people do not have the means to buy it. More than 90 percent of the hunger in the world is due, not to emergencies like drought or natural disaster, but to poverty. In developing countries economic growth originating in the agricultural sector is at least twice as effective in reducing poverty as growth originating elsewhere. To solve the problems of poverty and hunger, the agriculture sector in these countries – particularly smallholder agriculture in which women are the driving force – must play a much more effective role. For Alice Kachere, things are looking better. She now farms one hectare and has begun renting some land to expand her farm thanks to a tenfold increase in her maize yields due to better planting techniques, hybrid seeds, fertilizer and organic manure – farming practices she learned through membership in the National Smallholder Farmers’ Association of Malawi. She regrets that microcredit in her community is only for men and dreams about moving beyond crop production, about starting a business. Several years ago while visiting a rural women’s project, I, like Sarala, remarked on the lost opportunity of a female labour force mired in drudgery. (Collectively, women from sub-Saharan Africa spend an astounding 40 billion hours a year simply collecting water!) “What else would women do?” my (male) host said. Rural women are active economic agents who could unleash major advancements in hunger and poverty eradication if they were able to participate equally with men in the agricultural economy. They aren’t a problem to be solved. They’re a solution. Give women like Alice, Cesarie and Sarala access to land and credit, modern seeds and tools, information and a voice in decision-making, and just watch what they will do."

      "article_text": "FAO-IFAD publication shares success stories of small producers. A women's cooperative in the Dominican Republic. [FAO/G. Bizzarri] Strong rural organizations like producer groups and cooperatives are crucial to hunger and poverty reduction. They allow small producers to play a greater role in meeting growing food demand on local, national and international markets, while improving their own economic, social and political opportunities. This thinking connects a series of case studies found in a new publication by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD). The publication, Good practices in building innovative rural institutions to increase food security , released during the International Year of Cooperatives , presents thirty-five cases of successful institutional innovations that have empowered small-scale producers, and contributed to food security in different regions in the world. \"In order to be fully productive, small farmers, fisher folk, livestock keepers and forest users in developing countries are in dire need of services that are lacking in rural areas,\" say FAO Director-General José Graziano da Silva and IFAD President Kanayo F. Nwanze in the publication's foreword. \"There is a need to recognize the critical role of these innovative organizations and institutional arrangements in order to be more effective in poverty reduction and food security efforts,\" they continue. The case studies describe some of the services and resources that these institutional arrangements and new models of public-private engagement can offer to small-scale producers. They include accessing and managing natural resources; providing inputs like seeds and equipment; enabling access to markets; improving information and communication, and helping small producers to have a voice in decision-making processes. Farmer Field Schools developed by FAO in Asia, and subsequently in Africa, have enabled millions of small farmers to analyze their production systems; identify their risks and opportunities and test solutions, and adopt new practices that lead to improvements in their livelihoods and food security. West African and Indian farmer groups have helped members to obtain short-term credit through a \"warehouse receipt system\". In collaboration with micro-finance institutions, they have provided storage facilities for agricultural products. The receipts are then used as guarantees to obtain short-term credit. In India, where a disastrous harvest can lead poor people to mortgage their lands, a women's association has provided loans to release mortgaged land and free borrowers from dealing with money lenders. In Cameroon, farmers' groups, collectors, buyers, resellers and researchers collaborated to select a new plantain variety that fetches a higher price than traditional plaintains. The new variety is also used to make specialty dishes and chips. This has led to the emergence of small groups, including dozens of women's groups, concerned not only with the production and sale of bunches, but also with processing the plantain into chips. In the Gambia, the National Fisheries Post Harvest Operator Platform is a mechanism for dialogue where governments can learn about small producers' needs while producers express their concerns and preferences. In Honduras, greater control over natural resources was transferred to local communities as part of the decentralization process, resulting in better land management and cropping practices. These Community Development Councils, representing rural families, participated in the Municipal Council and managed to ban slash-and-burn agriculture. Some of the case studies also demonstrate the importance of including youth in small producer organizations and in decision-making processes. \"While highlighting the success factors for small producer organizations to thrive, these good practices can allow development practitioners and other stakeholders to learn from successful initiatives in various countries, to support them and replicate them. We hope that policy-makers and development practitioners in developing countries will build on insights from this set of case studies to promote innovative types of partnerships involving relevant stakeholders for effective food security strategies and rural development,\" write Graziano da Silva and Nwanze. Support for women Women in developing countries are among those who have benefited from rural organizations and other innovative institutions. Women make up, on average, 43 percent of the agricultural labour force in developing countries, but tend to have lower-paid, less secure forms of employment and less access than men to agricultural resources like land, livestock, farm labour, education, extension services, credit, fertilizers and mechanical equipment. The Good practices publication shows how rural organizations, including cooperatives, can help women farmers to overcome the social, economic and environmental constraints they face, by providing services such as access to markets, information, extension, and natural resources: In India, members of a women's association increased their vegetable production through better management of natural resources. The women have used watershed development techniques, such as building stone bunds, or ridges, and vegetative barriers, to control soil erosion, and reclaimed 3 000 hectares of ravine lands in 73 villages. In Burkina Faso, a microfinance network has provided short-term credit to women in order to support their development of parboiled rice, which tends to be more marketable due to its improved flavour and nutritional values. A water-use association in Ghana helps women to gain access to land for vegetable production by collecting a fee for annual membership that entitles each woman to a vegetable plot. Producer organizations combined with links to non-governmental organizations (NGOs), the research community, and public and private actors also help small-scale producers, both men and women, to voice their concerns and interests in order to influence policy-making processes."

In partnership with the Huairou Commission and WOCAN, FAO held a series of twenty one consult A woman farmer harvests beans in Sri Lanka. [FAO/I. Kodikara] Today’s global food insecurity destabilizes rural communities all over the world, impeding their access to food and affecting their ability to earn a livelihood. While both rural men and women suffer heavily from this situation, women, who are the traditional providers and preparers of food for their families and communities, tend to be disproportionately affected because of their lack of access to resources like credit, land, technologies and infrastructure, and as such, elaborate distinctive coping strategies. FAO, in partnership with the Huairou Commission and Women Organizing for Change in Agriculture & NRM (WOCAN), held a series of twenty one consultations with hundreds of women and some men from women’s groups in Uganda, Ghana, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, Cameroon, Benin, Ethiopia, India, Nepal, the Philippines, Pakistan, Nicaragua, Jamaica, Honduras, Guatemala, Peru, Argentina, Bolivia and Ecuador to better understand the direct impacts of food security on their lives and those of their families. The participants voiced their perspectives on the root causes of food insecurity and talked of the consequences on their lives and their communities and of the initiatives and solutions they were devising to survive. Here is an overview of the discussions: Rural women’s perspectives on the root causes of food insecurity High food prices and export and import policies \"The cultivation of traditional foods has decreased in favor of cash crops so we have less available food. But also, the prices for our crops have considerably dropped and our income from them does not allow us to spend more on alternative foods for consumption.\" Participating woman farmer, Pakistan. Across all regions, the first items rural women talked about as major causes of food insecurity were high food prices and reduced incomes, the rising costs for agricultural inputs, and current import and export measures. In Africa, the women deplored the fact that cheap imported foods have hurt local subsistence farmers, leaving them unable to compete and threatening their livelihoods. This was echoed by the women in Latin America, who also talked about the unfairly low prices smallholder farmers received from intermediaries for their produce. On the other hand, in Asia, women explained that because of their governments’ growing interest in exporting agricultural products, especially cash crops, the cultivation of traditional nutritious foods grown for local consumption like pulses, wheat and rice, had fallen, causing a loss in food diversity and nutritional intake. Across all regions, the different measures taken are similarly hurting smallholder farmers and causing communities to rely on cheaper and less nutritious imported food. \"The way the climate is now, it confuses us. Before, we knew that mid March was the time we expected rain and after the rain had fallen, we could plant our crops. But at times rains started coming earlier... Now we will go and plant our crops and when the crops start giving shoots, a very harsh sun will come and destroy them, and so we are confused about the climate and we do not know when to plant.” Participating woman farmer, Cameroon Climate change and damaging agricultural practices Climate change is experienced as a major threat. In Africa, the women explained that the phenomenon was increasingly delaying the arrival of rain while prolonging the rainy season and causing destructive winds, landslides, bush fire, and deforestation, all of which were making farming very difficult and leading to the loss of crops. In Asia, the women explained that the cultivation of traditional crops previously relied on sustainable and ecological methods and questioned the growing dependency on harsh fertilizers and pesticides, saying that these methods had damaged entire crops, polluted the soil, air and sources of water and endangered biodiversity. This was also brought up in Latin America where some of the groups explained that transnational businesses were overusing agrochemicals and fertilizers and that they had seen birds and insects disappearing, which was degrading the soil. Many talked of falling into debt when their harvest was destroyed. They added that damaging natural capital was making economic activity impossible. Lack of access to capital, land and property, and privatization In all regions, and particularly in Africa, the women discussed their lack of access to capital, land, credit, and to property because of insufficient legal rights or customary laws, issues that were affecting their ability to produce and to earn an income. They also discussed the increasing privatization of land, where big companies were buying up arable land to produce cash crops. In Africa, this has been causing rural women to travel greater and greater distances to find available land and to be subjected to higher payments by landlords. The problem of land grabbing by governments was also discussed and seen as a big concern for food security. \"Without land we will die of hunger.\" Participating woman farmer, Nepal For example, the women in a group in Nepal explained that the government wanted their land to build a major thoroughfare. In Africa, the women also talked about the poor infrastructure that was preventing access to markets and leaving communities unable to sell or buy. The lack of machinery, technology and storing facilities also made it impossible to process and preserve foods. Political instability and graft In Latin America, political instability was cited as exacerbating food insecurity with a freeze on international aid in some cases, and in Africa, many women reported instances of graft, such as the sell of tainted seeds and fake pesticides on markets, which was worsening the situation. Food insecurity affects rural women’s lives and the lives of their families and communitie s \"The family responsibility lies on women so that she distributes all available food for her children, husband, and other family members. If some of the food items are left she will have it, if not she suffers from hunger.” Participating woman farmer, Ethiopia Across all of Africa and Asia, rural women noted that they and their children were the hardest hit. Women, who are traditionally responsible for maintaining the food security of the household, tend to be the first to go hungry as they give their food to other family members first. They have also widely taken on additional work and diversified their income-generating activities on top of their existing responsibilities. Between hunger, extra work and other effects of food insecurity, many of them said that they and others had fallen seriously ill. In general, food insecurity has had an important negative impact on people’s health. In addition to malnutrition, children and adults have become more vulnerable to depression, illnesses have been aggravated, and participants spoke of increased levels of alcoholism. People living with HIV/AIDS have also been severely affected--without access to antiretroviral therapy and well balanced, nutrient diets the condition of many has declined rapidly. The insecurity is also destabilizing relationships within households in many ways. In Benin, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, and Zambia, the women said that many men were either abandoning their families or migrating in search of work and income to send money back, leaving the women as the heads of households. Women and youth were also increasingly moving to cities or large scale farms to find work, leaving behind the children and the elderly. \"If some family needed support to obtain food, we used to help them. Now we do not have food in storage, so help between the people in the community has decreased. Finding enough food for one’s own family has become the priority.\" Participating woman farmer, Nepal In Africa, participants explained that instances of women being dispossessed of their land and property by in-laws or other groups were on the rise, and in Asia, many were trapped in a circle of debt and had been forced to sell personal belongings. The women also explained that the social fabric of communities had deteriorated. The difficulties were so great and had been lasting for so long that people were no longer able to help each other and robberies and other illegal activities were on the rise. Sexual violence and prostitution were also worsening, increasing women’s exposure to HIV and AIDS and other health problems. \"If a woman becomes poor, the household suffers, children will not go to school, they will not have good paid jobs, the health of children suffers too, the family remains poor and we end up with a community of illiterates with no skills and no money.\" Participating woman farmer, Ghana In all regions, women expressed very deep concerns about having to take their children --especially girls—out of school because school fee money was needed to purchase food or because they needed their children to go to work to earn an income or to help with household tasks. They said that children in school were also having problems learning because of malnutrition. In Africa, young girls were being more often forced into early marriages as their families could no longer feed them. How rural women cope with the situation \"Most households could not afford onions in our village. One woman in the village had access to some land and water, but she did not have the money to invest in crops. Together, other women from the village bought seeds to grow onions on the available land. As a result, many households have access to onions. It would not have been the case if we had not put together our resources.” Participating woman farmer, India Throughout all regions, rural women have been extremely industrious and inventive in coming up with solutions to soften the blow of food insecurity on their families and communities. In Asia, Africa and Latin America, rural women have organized collective farming initiatives to return to a greater cultivation of traditional food crops using traditional methods of farming including the use of manure as fertilizer and of ash as seed preservatives. They have started to share land and seeds, and the costs of expenses such as tractor services to plow the fields in order to maximize harvests. They have been devising farming methods to grow crops on depleted soils or with less water, such as the use of logs to channel water to the crops. With the help of grassroots organizations, they have also created savings groups and credit collectives. For example, in India, the participants explained that they had created the Thankot Women’s Savings and Credit Cooperatives, which have been a reliable resource for women to cope with rising food prices. They have also diversified their sources of income, such as selling crafts, and formed business partnerships. \"We have introduced a food bank. This is generally a place where we bring an agreed share of food for storage during the harvesting seasons. During the drought, this has been our safe haven. Many families have benefited from this initiative.\" Participating woman farmer, Kenya In Kenya and Ghana, rural communities have created food banks to store produce, allocating portions to the neediest families and developing canning techniques to prevent the food from perishing. In Asia, women have organized local actions to support the prioritization of crop production for local consumption and to sell to local villages before selling to large markets. In Ecuador, Latin America, women’s movement and indigenous movements jointly organized actions to push for the repeal of laws going against their economic, political and cultural rights, and to create new laws that better protect them. Everywhere, the participating women called for support from local organizations and from the government with social protection programmes. In Asia, the women asked for local organizations to support communities with crop management, diversification and training on new techniques and for the government to help with irrigation mechanisms, family planning and with the organization of gender networks to share knowledge and education. This was also the case in Africa, where women also wished governments would better support their land ownership rights and their productivity through better agricultural mechanization, subsidized inputs like fertilizers and better access to technologies and credit. In Latin America, the women asked for governments to support stores where producers can trade directly with consumers without intermediaries, to provide special loans for agro-ecological production, and to improve access to land and credit. \"To avoid depending on rain fed crops, I risked my meager savings and drilled a borehole. I have been able to irrigate my vegetables and my household spending has considerably decreased.\" Participating woman farmer, Kenya In all regions, women also recommended that governments modify their trade strategies to better support local production. Across the regions, the combination of poverty and the lack of social structures have compelled women to build their own support networks to protect themselves and their families from the impacts of food insecurity. While these women’s courage in recognizing that they and their communities must become increasingly self reliant, and their resourcefulness in devising coping strategies that have shielded their families from many hardships, the discussions have made clear that they cannot alone face food insecurity and that more support is needed from governments in the form of social protection schemes that will decrease vulnerability to transient shock while mitigating the risks of future crises."

      "article_text": "Poor rural households in developing countries were the hardest hit by the 2006-2008 food crisis, with women at a particular disadvantage because of their lack of access to resources like credit, land, technologies and infrastructure. The crisis has drawn Women buying fruit in a downtown market in Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. FAO is implementing its Initiative on Soaring Food Prices (ISFP)* in the country to rapidly boost food production. [© FAO/A. Benedetti] During the 2006-2008 food crisis, international prices for staple foods rose dramatically, pushing more people worldwide into hunger and undernourishment than ever before. Prices declined in the second half of 2008 but spiked again in 2010 and will likely remain high and volatile over the next decade. As in previous global crises, poor rural households in developing countries were the hardest hit. Poor rural women were particularly affected because they lag behind in access to resources like credit, land, technologies and infrastructure, which reduces their purchasing power. The crisis has drawn attention to the vulnerability of poor countries and populations to global shocks and to the need for countries to put in place better mechanisms to protect the most vulnerable populations. The impact of high food prices on poor rural households Rural households have little to no resources—such as savings or access to credit—to help them face high food prices, and the poorer the household, the more its members have to change their way of living to cope: they reduce spending on non-food items like healthcare and education; eat smaller or fewer meals and less expensive, less nutritious food; borrow money to buy food; and work longer hours or take on additional work to earn more money. How do rural women cope with high food prices? Rural women adopt specific behaviors and measures to soften the effects of high food prices on their families: As the traditional food providers and carers for their households, they tend to act as ‘shock absorbers’, giving their food to their children and their husbands to prevent them from going hungry, and spending more time caring for sick relatives as households cut back on health expenses. “Prices of food have really gone up and this has made my children and I not eat as we used to. We used to eat four times a day but now we can only eat two times under hard struggle.” -- Salome Nche, mother of eight, Cameroon. 1 Women also look for more part-time employment or work longer hours on top of their existing jobs and household responsibilities to earn more money for their families. They may also look for additional credit to afford food and other basic necessities, and are susceptible to get into debt because their lack of access to formal credit may force them to turn to moneylenders, pawn brokers and other sources of expensive credit. To cope with higher food prices, poor households at times have to sell assets, like livestock, seeds, or tools, which are very difficult to regain. Women’s traditional assets, like jewellery and small livestock, tend to be sold first because they are easier to recover later than men’s assets such as land and large livestock. Children are also affected—they may be taken out of school to either be sent to work to supplement the family’s income or to help with household chores while their mothers take on additional work. The former is more likely for boys and the latter for girls. What can governments do to support rural women and rural households to deal with high food prices? Countries can support rural households, and especially rural women, to cope with high food prices by putting in place or expanding food assistance and social safety net programmes that take into consideration men and women’s different roles and responsibilities within households and the different behaviors they adopt in times of crisis. Through food assistance schemes, governments provide households with food rations to compensate for lacking food supplies. This includes giving households food stamps or vouchers that people can exchange for food, implementing school feeding programmes where meals are given to children in school, and food-for-work programmes where people are given food rations in exchange for their work on public projects like building roads. Social safety net programmes work similarly, except that they provide households with cash to buy food and other necessities instead of food rations. These programmes include cash transfers where governments give periodical payments to households, and public work programmes, which are similar to food-for-work programmes, except that they compensate people in cash. Food assistance programmes are advantageous for rural women who are traditionally responsible for obtaining food and ensuring good nutrition for the family. These programmes may reduce women’s need to take on additional work to obtain more income to buy food and, in some cases, increase their decision-making power in the household. For example, in Ethiopia, women working in public work schemes indicated that they preferred being paid in food rations rather than cash as this prevents their husbands from spending earned resources on non-food items. School feeding schemes are also a helpful measure because they motivate parents to keep children in school in times of crises, ensuring that they receive the nutrients they need and maintaining their chances at better opportunities later in life. These schemes are particularly important for girls, who tend to be pulled out of school before boys. Cash transfers are also instrumental in supporting women, especially when the transfer is directed directly to them, and public work programmes that are designed to include them have many beneficial effects, including improving their access to credit since their participation in the programme is often viewed as a guarantee of repayment. By building programmes that take into consideration rural women and men’s differentiated needs and resources, governments can better strengthen rural communities’ resilience and ability to cope with high food prices and food price sparks in the long run. 1 .

In her opening remarks, the US Secretary of State echoed the conclusions of FAO’s latest State of Food and Agriculture report. “If all farmers, both men and women, had access to the same resources, agricultural output could increase by 20-30 percent. That would feed an additional 150 million people every year,” she said."

ONG VIE Coordinator Ali Abdoulaye explains the reasons for the pro Women from the village of Datchandou, Niger, participating in the creation of a radio program. [FAO/Dimitra] In 2008, Dimitra and its partner in Niger, ONG VIE Kande ni Bayra , started supporting the creation of rural “community listeners’ clubs” –public forums to enable women and men to participate actively in their community life by exchanging information, knowledge and opinions and to share in decision-making. To improve the clubs’ access to information, Dimitra and ONG VIE provided them with crank and solar radios, and later with solar powered phones to communicate with the radio stations and other listeners’ clubs. A success beyond all expectations, the initiative not only gave women, who make up the majority of the clubs' participants, a greater voice, it also enabled networking among communities and broke their isolation. The initiative was formalized in 2009 into a project entitled “Creation of listener’s clubs for rural women’s empowerment and leadership” with funding from FAO, UNDP, UNIFEM, UNFPA and bilateral organizations (Canadian, Swiss and Belgian Cooperation). Two years on, the project has grown into a network of over 500 listeners’ clubs in three regions of Niger -- Tillabéri, Dosso and Zinder. The clubs share valuable information on an ongoing basis through the communication technologies provided and the collaboration of their local community radio stations. ONG VIE Kande ni Bayra’s Coordinator Ali Abdoulaye explains the reasons for the project’s success. Tell us about the very beginning of the listeners’ clubs initiative and how it came about. In 2006, Dimitra and ONG VIE held a workshop for rural women entitled “Women, literacy and communication,” in Dosso. The participating rural women were from several communities in Western and Southern Niger and told us about their inability to participate in decision making in their communities, partly due to their lack of access to information and low literacy rates. We looked for a way to address these two needs at the same time and, in 2008, decided to add a new, experimental function to the literacy training centers already run by ONG VIE: they also became a tool to set up “listeners’ clubs,” where women and men could gather to discuss various issues of their own choice and listen to radio programmes of interest via crank and solar radios we provided. We later equipped the clubs with cell phones using solar energy chargers to call the radio stations to ask questions and share knowledge. Did this meet the information needs of the rural women who took part in the initiative? It improved their situation significantly—through the radio, they received information on a range of subjects of importance to them: where to buy inputs, prices of food and commodities, etc, and they began sharing their knowledge. But then, the women didn’t stop there. They started using the phones to call other listeners’ clubs to share the information with them and get their views, sometimes about the topics discussed on the radio programmes, sometimes about other topics. And men were participating too. How has the project evolved since its beginning? An increasing number of communities asked to participate and we started providing radios and phones to more and more groups who organized themselves into listeners’ clubs. When we couldn’t provide the material, communities pulled their resources together to buy the equipment themselves. There was a clear need, the network was growing and it needed more support. FAO, UNDP, UNIFEM, UNFPA and bilateral organizations (Canadian, Swiss and Belgian Cooperation) stepped in to provide funds and we were able to structure the initiative into a full blown project in 2009. Today, the network is constituted of over 500 clubs with close to 10,000 members including 2,500 men, and 13 community radio stations. The Emergency Coordination Unit of FAO in Niger has also started using the listeners’ clubs to obtain quick and clear feedback on their activities. Can you tell us more about the way the project functions at the community level and how it benefits the participants? In each community, women and men have separate weekly meetings where they discuss their own priority issues. This allows women to talk freely among themselves and formulate their opinions clearly. Then later in the week the whole community meets once or twice to discuss these issues and decide together what actions need to be taken. When a group believes an issue is of interest to the other communities in the network, they alert their local radio station, which in turn alerts the clubs. Each community discusses the issue at hand and makes a summary of its members’ opinions, knowledge and recommendations. With support from the project, the radio station gathers these and creates a programme, which it broadcasts back to the clubs. An expert is present at the radio station during the broadcast to take questions. Thus, through the clubs, the communities put their knowledge together to find solutions. How has the project improved the lives and status of the rural women involved? The women are at the heart of the listeners’ clubs. Most often it is they who decide which issues need to be discussed. The project has given them access to information and knowledge, a voice, and the confidence to express themselves. Their role and capacities are now recognized and they have become an integral part of the decision making processes within their communities. They can be leaders and shape the decisions that affect them. How have the men reacted to the changes brought on by the project and how has it impacted their lives? The men are proud and they are relieved to now be able to share the responsibility of decision making with women. To a certain extent, they felt that the women had not been fully assuming their responsibilities, which they couldn’t do without access to information and without the confidence to express themselves. They trust women’s capacity more. Within households, men and women talk a lot more too. Has the Listeners’ Club Project improved food security for the communities involved? Indeed it has. Participants share a lot of practical information about agricultural practices and this has improved their yields. They regularly talk about which seeds are best adapted to which type of environment, where to buy these seeds, who has the best stocks, which prices they should be bought at, etc. These topics are most discussed in April and May. In June, planting season, the participants exchange a lot of information about soil types and quality, the best planting techniques, which fertilizers are most appropriate and when they should be applied. FAO provides its assistance when required. To give you an example, the village of Gasséda, located 70 km east of the capital city Niamey, has a bean variety that it traditionally grew. In the past years, there has been an important shortfall of rain in this area and this bean could no longer mature. Thanks to the club, the village received information from other communities about varieties that would thrive in the new conditions they were experiencing. They switched to growing the recommended varieties, which had a yield 30 to 40 percent higher than their traditional bean. Not only did they prevent a food deficit, they also had enough stocks to sell, which allowed them to buy rice and other cereals and diversify their diet. They were used to cultivating for subsistence only and realized that it could also generate revenues. In your view, what has made this project so successful? We actually had not foreseen the extent of the success! I think the main factor is that the format of the project adequately responded to the need for information and means of communication of the communities involved. They assumed full ownership of the project, shaped it and gave it its direction. We took their lead and adapted our actions and support to their needs. What are the next steps for the Listener’s Clubs network in Niger? We have begun working with the FAO Emergency Coordination Unit, UNFPA and UNICEF to relay their messages. On May 1, 2011, UNICEF will start working with nine Listeners’ Clubs to transmit information about the “Essential Family Practices” they have elaborated. This will be done in the usual way through radio programmes that will be discussed within and among the clubs. UNICEF has found in the past that the Listeners’ Clubs network was a very efficient way of communicating their development messages. In early 2012, UNICEF will carry out an impact evaluation to determine the extent to which the communities have adopted the practices and how these results compare with those of their previous communication for development initiatives. With FAO Emergencies , we will be providing the clubs with information about inputs shops and fertilizers and with UNFPA about maternal and child health and gender equity."

The consensus to come out of all the events is that action towards empowering women in agriculture is long overdue and that there is an urgent need to implement the policy recommendations outlined in the report—creating agricultural policies that consider gender differences, ensuring equality for women under the law, investing in the human capital of women and girls, addressing the multiple constraints of women in agriculture holistically and providing public services and technologies to free up women’s time—in order to improve the lives of rural women and to meet the increasingly complex challenge of food security for a rapidly growing global population.",
      "article_text": "The findings of FAO’s recently launched State of Food and Agriculture report 2010-11 (SOFA): “Women in Agriculture: Closing the gender gap for development,” were the focus of a high-level roundtable debate organized by the three Rome-based UN agencies - F View of the panel during the FAO, IFAD and WFP International Women’s Day event held at FAO headquarters. [FAO/G. Napolitano] Investing in gender in agriculture: A high-return initiative Moderated by BBC anchor Zeinab Badawi, the event in Rome brought together a regionally diverse panel of agricultural experts from the UN, governments, academia, foundations and farmers’ organizations to discuss the messages and findings of the report, as well as its recommendations for appropriate actions governments, policy makers, civil society and the private sector can take to close the gender gap. FAO Assistant Director-General Hafez Ghanem opened the discussion by outlining the main messages and findings of the SOFA: The agricultural sector of developing countries is underperforming, in large part because women farmers are denied equal access to resources including education, land, technology, seed, fertilizers and credit. As a result, while they are as productive as men farmers, their yields are on average 20 to 30 percent lower. If the gender gap in access to resources was closed, the resulting increase in agricultural production in developing countries would lift 100 to 150 million children, women and men out of hunger. “I would like to tell the development community that gender is not only something you take into consideration because it is the right thing to do. It is indeed the right thing. But you will also not be able to succeed in fighting hunger and poverty around the world unless you take it into consideration,” Mr. Ghanem explained. Kevin Cleaver, IFAD Associate Vice President, added that given the extent of the gender gap in agriculture, the international community would get “a very big bang from increasing women’s access to resources” in terms of food production, an important step towards building up the world’s capacity to feed a global population projected to reach 9 billion by 2050. However, he warned that no advance would be made unless investments in agriculture increased, and he underlined the neglect the sector had been subjected to in the past decades. President of Liberia Ellen Johnson Sirleaf, participating via a pre-recorded statement, stated she was not surprised by the findings of the report and that, having herself been engaged in the fight for women’s empowerment for decades, she was convinced women were the key to food and economic security. “The message of the report, and my message to you, is that food security and agricultural development cannot be achieved without the empowerment of women.” Also joining via pre-recorded statement, US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton emphasized the greater benefits of women’s empowerment: “By increasing our support for women farmers, we can increase food production, improve nutrition, health, and education, help women earn higher incomes and support broader economic growth,” and Jacobo Regalado, Minister of Agriculture and Livestock of Honduras, pointed out the importance of improving women’s access to credit for the agricultural sector of Latin America. Lack of access to land ownership and insufficient data: two great obstacles The lack of access to land tenure and ownership for women working in agriculture was widely cited by participants as the foremost obstacle to their productivity. Elizabeth Atananga, President of the Pan-African Farmers’ organization, explained that customary practices make land ownership for women a particularly complex issue: “The laws are generally simple and grant rights to land to every child in a family. However, culturally, I [as a woman] cannot claim land—people consider that I should use my husband’s plots. If I insist, I have to undertake legal action. I would be acting in accordance with the law, but culturally, people would consider that I am stealing land from another person.” Ms. Atananga underlined the importance of setting aside funding to undertake consultations with traditional chiefs and other community leaders to foster better access to land for women. Bina Agarwal, Director and Professor of Economics at the Institute of Economic Growth of the University of Delhi, shared her experience in Asia where women increasingly organize into groups to rent or purchase land—a method which has proved effective and in some cases has led to a production capacity high enough for these groups to engage in contract farming. The scarcity of available sex-disaggregated data was also repeatedly stressed as an important impediment to identifying the specific needs of women in agriculture, and in turn to informing policies and designing interventions to appropriately address these. Participants stressed the necessity for more data on access to land, water, equipment, inputs, information and credit. Calling for a greater role of the private sector Circling back to the need for higher investments, the discussion turned to the potential role of the private sector in closing the gender gap in agriculture. Ann Tutweiler, recently appointed FAO Deputy Director-General, expressed optimism that the agribusiness community had begun to pay attention to agriculture in the last few years and that the timing was right to call their attention to gender equality: “The agribusiness community has finally understood the role of agriculture in reducing poverty and the fact that poor consumers are not going to buy their products. I think we should take advantage of this particular time and take our message to the business community to get them to start thinking about how they can address gender issues in the way they are doing business, the way they are contracting and doing extension work. I think they will welcome this discussion.” The roundtable also included the participation of Pasquale Lucio Scandizzo, Director and Professor of Political Economy at the Center for Economic and International Studies of the University of Rome, Thenjiwe Ethel Mtintso, H.E. Ambassador of the Republic of South Africa, Hans-Heinrich Wrede, H.E. Ambassador of the Federal Republic of Germany, Arlene Mitchell, Senior Program Officer for the Agricultural Development Program, Market Access Team of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and Georgia Shaver, Director of Mediation Services at the World Food Programme. SOFA 2010-11 around the world Several FAO regional and country offices also held presentations, discussions and press conferences on the findings of the SOFA pertaining to the issues and challenges women in agriculture face in their specific regions. FAO’s Regional Office for Europe and Central Asia in Budapest held a press conference hosted by Regional Representative Fernanda Guerrieri, which focused on region specific gender issues, such as the migration of rural women. A presentation of the main findings of SOFA was also held for ambassadors and representatives of the UN and other international agencies. The unavailability of sex disaggregated data was discussed and the Regional Statistician, Salar Tayyib, indicated that an extensive data research exercise was being undertaken by the Regional Office to address this issue, and would result in a publication on the status of rural women in Europe and Central Asia. Speaking at the Regional Office for Africa located in Accra, Ghana, FAO Assistant Director-General Helena Semedo announced preliminary plans to organise a high level event convening Ministers of Agriculture and Finance of African nations to discuss the findings of the report as they relate to agricultural policy, development practice and women in agriculture in Africa, with an emphasis on the role of statistics in supporting change. In the Nairobi, Kenya country office, discussions were held with representatives from the World Bank, IFAD, the Ford Foundation, Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa, and other specialists focusing on the need and the strategies to collect better sex-disaggregated data. The presentation held by the Karthoum, Sudan office, constituted its first celebration of International Women’s Day. The figures and key messages from the SOFA were discussed and linked with the reality of Sudan, where 70% of women are involved in agriculture and have very little access to resources. As part of International Women’s Week, FAO’s Liaison Office with the United Nations in Geneva organized a press conference as well as a high level panel discussion on the SOFA findings in collaboration with the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights. Discussions featured Elizabeth Prügl, Vice Director and Professor at the Graduate Institute of International and Development Studies in Geneva, Magdi Farahat, Representative of the Economic Commission for Africa in Geneva, and Marcela Villarreal, Director of the Gender, Equity and Rural Employment Division of FAO. Talks focused on the impact of customary norms on the rights of women in agriculture and the challenges these pose to compliance with the law, as well as on the consequences of international trade on rural women. In a news article published in the Tribune de Genève, Abdessalam Ould Ahmed, Director of FAO’s Liaison Office, pointed out FAO’s advocacy for greater political will to empower women and its recommendation that developing countries dedicate 10 percent of their budget to agriculture. The Santiago, Chile Regional Office for Latin America and the Caribbean held a press conference and a technical workshop on the findings of the SOFA with the participation of representatives from twelve Country Offices in Latin America and members of the Government and of women’s organizations from Guatemala and Peru. Regional Representative Alan Bojanic and Economists Ana Paula de la O Campo and Gustavo Anríquez highlighted the progress achieved over the past decades for rural women in Latin America, many of whom left unpaid domestic work to enter the labour market as farm labourers and workers in industries connected with agriculture and services. Additionally, women have become prevalent as workers in high-value agro-industries. The presenters explained that these changes have led to greater decision-making powers for women in the household and improved family welfare indicators for nutrition and education but warned that much is left to achieve. FAO representatives from the Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific in Bangkok presented data from the report at a recent event organized by the UN Inter-Agency Technical Working Group on Gender. Key findings and follow-up actions will be discussed at a regional meeting with participants from FAO’s country offices in Asia, members of governments and diplomatic representatives. FAO’s Liaison Office with the United Nations in New York held a presentation with the participation of Ms. Lila H. Ratsifandrihamanana, Director of the FAO Liaison Office, Abulkalam Abdul Momen, H.E. Ambassador of Bangladesh and Vice President of ECOSOC, Ms Marcela Villarreal, Director of FAO’s Gender, Equity and Rural Employment Division, Ms Winnie Byanyima, Director of the Gender Team of UNDP (TBD), and Ms Joanne Sandler, Deputy Director of UN Women. More presentations on the findings and policy recommendations of the SOFA 2010-11 will be held throughout the world in the coming months. The consensus to come out of all the events is that action towards empowering women in agriculture is long overdue and that there is an urgent need to implement the policy recommendations outlined in the report—creating agricultural policies that consider gender differences, ensuring equality for women under the law, investing in the human capital of women and girls, addressing the multiple constraints of women in agriculture holistically and providing public services and technologies to free up women’s time—in order to improve the lives of rural women and to meet the increasingly complex challenge of food security for a rapidly growing global population."

A woman scientist in a greenhouse of the Indian Agricultural Research Institute taking seeds from one particular variety of wheat. [FAO/J. Spaull] During its annual session to review progress on gender equality and to identify critical areas where challenges remain, CSW invited Member States representatives, United Nations agencies and NGOs from all regions of the world to share experiences and lessons learned on this year’s theme: Access and participation of women and girls in education, training, science and technology, including for the promotion of women’s equal access to full employment and decent work. At the CSW, FAO together with IFAD, WFP and the World Bank, held two side events that focused on the practical steps needed to improve rural women’s access to productive technologies. Together with IFAD and the World Bank , FAO presented research and experiences, carried out jointly with IFAD, on the use of agricultural technologies among small and resource-poor farmers, as well as discussed new farming techniques to help increase food security and enhance the livelihoods of rural women and men. Eve Crowley - Principal Advisor, Gender, Equity and Rural Employment Division - discusses some of the benefits that science and technology brings to rural women, and the obstacles preventing them from taking full advantage of agricultural innovations: How can science and technology benefit and empower rural women? Science and technology offers solutions to many challenges faced by rural women: they can contribute to food security by boosting crop yields; reduce women’s domestic and productive work by introducing labour-saving technologies; and increase participation of women in the rural labour market through better communications. Women can also benefit greatly from tools that encourage knowledge and information sharing. When made available to them, new and basic Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) can help reduce women’s isolation, improve their bargaining power and ability to pool skills. A good example of this are the community-learning centers run by the Self Employed Women’s Association (SEWA) in India, which use innovations such as satellite and telecommunication to enable women to access agricultural extension, soil and pest analysis, and health diagnostic expertise even in remote rural areas. Some centres contain equipment libraries with innovative technology-sharing arrangements that allow poor women to access technologies, which would otherwise be unavailable to them. Female leaders from different villages also help to identify village demand for improved certified seeds and other technologies - then purchase them wholesale, and ensure they reach women farmers who need them most. This is a significant innovation in contexts where small and marginal farmers are usually bypassed by national extension systems. What are some key challenges faced by rural women trying to access science and technology? Access to land, credit and education are often pre-requisites for technology uptake. Similarly, farm inputs and services are often only available to landowners. As a result, barriers that constrain women’s access to key resources also lead to inequalities in access to and adoption of new technologies. When women are involved in the design and field testing of new agricultural technologies, such as crop varieties, small machinery, and farm tools – these technologies are more likely to work for them. Women are consequently more likely to adopt innovations, which can boost agricultural productivity and rural incomes. Yet there are some simple but revolutionary technologies, like animal traction, which are still under-exploited by women. This is because the size, design or weight of the implements fail to consider women’s physical needs and constraints. Finally, it is important for agricultural research to pay greater attention to some of the crops traditionally grown by women. Although crops like pigeon pea and leafy green vegetables may not feature prominently on global markets, they are often vital to household and community nutrition, as well as women’s income - even when only cultivated on a small scale. How can participation in science, technology and skills training increase rural women’s opportunities for decent employment? Access to formal education, as well as technical and vocational training can lead to more remunerative jobs and can give women access to a wider range of opportunities. To this day, over two-thirds of the world’s 796 million illiterate people are women, and many of them live in rural areas. In India, female farmers and agricultural workers lag behind their male counterparts at every level of educational attainment, and are between 20 and 30 percent more likely to be illiterate than men. Women’s participation in agricultural research – the cornerstone of successful food production strategies – is also key to ensuring their influence over the science research agenda. Women scientists and research managers can provide unique perspectives and help research agencies to address topics that affect rural women’s well-being and interests. Why is it important to include women in all aspects of scientific and technological innovation related to food security? Women’s indigenous knowledge and resourcefulness in agriculture can provide extensive contributions to food security and the overall innovation process. As the main collectors, users and managers of water - for instance - women have a vast knowledge about water use and conservation that is key to successful water policies and strategies. Science and technology can also contribute to food security through improved crops and cropping practices, improved quality of food processing, packaging and marketing. But in order for these innovations to be effective, equitable, and sustainable - they must benefit women and men equally. What is needed at the policy level to ensure that technological innovations reach both rural women and men? Policies must endorse research that incorporates rural women’s knowledge and that responds to their needs. In many parts of the world, rural women are responsible for housework, child care and other domestic activities. At the same time, they often seek sources of income which contribute to family welfare, and carry the responsibility for food production and household nutrition. As a result, it is important to develop appropriate technologies that reduce women’s drudgery and time spent on laborious household tasks like fetching water and fuelwood, food processing, or preparing meals. This will give them more time for productive employment and education, and to take part in community initatives. Public investments in infrastructure, which work towards the supply of electricity, water and transport – for instance - can go a long way to improving women’s livelihoods, as well as the food and agriculture systems in general. Successful programmes and policies must also go hand-in-hand with institutions that promote women’s involvement and empowerment. Farmer associations and cooperatives, self help groups and trade unions can be effective in disseminating technologies and representing the interests of farmers. Yet women are often excluded from these groups due to membership criteria, low levels of education or cultural barriers. Even when they make up a sizeable share of the members in these organizations, women’s representation in leadership positions is disproportionately low. The same can be said for extension services, which should hire women within their ranks, be designed to reach out more effectively, and be accountable to rural women as their clients. What would be the economic gains of rural women’s access to science and technology? The gender gap in science and technology is a major reason behind the underperformance of the agriculture sector. Achieving greater equality in women’s and men’s access to innovations will result in improved agricultural productivity, improved economic growth and a decline in the number of hungry people in the world. We must also remember that technology-related adoption rates are low among rural women because they face difficulties when accessing other resources. With the launch of its latest State of Food and Agriculture in March - FAO will be releasing new figures, which back up the argument that closing the gender gap in all spheres of agriculture is necessary to win the fight against hunger and extreme poverty. During CSW, FAO, on behalf of the three Rome-based agencies (FAO, IFAD and WFP), took part in a panel discussion hosted by UN Women to exchange ideas in view of next year's theme: The empowerment of rural women and their role in poverty and hunger eradication, development and current challenges . To help guide discussions on this issue, which is strongly interlinked with FAO’s mandate, we presented up-to-date findings on the status of women in agriculture and rural areas in different parts of the world."

This article presents a number of facts taken from the new UN interagency report: \"Gender dimensions of agricultural and rural employment: Di A Palestinian woman selling vegetables in the Alhspa Marketplace. [FAO/A. Romenzi] Agriculture is the main source of rural employment for both women and men in sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia and Southeast Asia. In Latin America, rural men work mostly in agriculture while women are equally distributed in the agricultural and non-agricultural sectors. In The Middle East and North Africa, women work mostly in agriculture and men mostly in non-agricultural sectors. Non-agricultural activities are the main source of employment for both men and women in Central Asia and Europe. In regions where agriculture is the main employer of rural populations, the number of working poor is particularly high. In 2008, 45.5 % in South Asia and 58.6 % in sub-Saharan Africa were in working poverty. Men and women are engaged in vulnerable employment in similar proportions worldwide, in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, where the working poor represent the majority of the working population, about 85 percent of women have vulnerable jobs, while only 75 percent of men face a same situation. Six out of ten of the world’s poorest people are women. When women receive the same levels of education, experience and farm inputs as men, there are no significant differences in male and female farmers’ productivity. Educating and providing women with opportunities to take part in skilled paid employment provides benefits to their families and communities in the form of lower fertility rates, decreased child mortality, increased child health and nutrition and improved levels of children’s education. Women employed as regular workers are less discriminated against in agriculture (where they get 79% of the male wage) than in other non agriculture sectors (which pay women only 57% of the male wage). Overall, rural women work longer hours then men. In Benin and Tanzania, women work, respectively, 17.4 and 14 hours more than men per week; while rural Indian women work almost 11 hours more than urban women and 12 hours more than urban men. Globally, an estimated 60 percent of the world’s 218 million child labourers are working in agriculture. Some 170,000 agricultural workers are killed each year and millions more are seriously injured. Accidents are markedly more frequent among men, probably due to their use of larger and more dangerous machinery."

The International Day of Rural Women takes place each year on Oc A woman sifting out dirt and stones from peanuts at the Galla Mandi Market in Multan, Pakistan. [FAO/A. Hafeez] Rural women form the backbone of the agricultural labour force across much of the developing world. Globally, more than a third of the female workforce is engaged in agriculture, while in regions like Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, more than 60 per cent of all female employment is in this sector. To afford food and other basic expenses, men and women in rural areas often diversify their income by combining multiple forms of employment. Women generally work as subsistence farmers, small-scale entrepreneurs, unpaid workers on family farms or casual wage labourers – but they may take on all or a number of these activities at different times. Because in many developing countries women carry out a range of vital household and caring tasks, their overall working hours tend to be longer than men’s. In countries like Benin and Tanzania, for example, rural women work respectively 17.4 and 14 hours longer per week than their male counterparts. Providing women with better opportunities to grow their own crops for sale, undertake paid work in an agro-industry, or take on other paid activities in the rural sector is critical to increasing their bargaining power within the home and can legitimize their control over key material resources, such as land and credit. This is important because it elevates their status within families and communities, but also because women are more likely than men to invest their income on food and other basic needs for the household. Keshta is 31 years old and lives with her husband and six children in Al-Shokha, a rural area in south east Gaza Strip, which suffered severe damage during the Israeli military campaign Operation Cast Lead. To supply the family with a much-needed income, a project sponsored by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) provided her with one male and five female rabbits, enough fodder for 3 months and training on rabbit maintenance. Thanks to this initiative, Keshta and her family now benefit directly from the sale of rabbits and she is able to reinvest part of her income on fodder and medicines to keep on breeding. \"The training conducted before receiving the rabbit unit developed my capacity and enabled me to use the vaccines and veterinary medicines easily,” she said. Protein from rabbit consumption has also enriched her children’s diet and boosted the family’s resilience to food insecurity. \"The project gave me a great opportunity to be a contributing member of my family. The family income has increased. We are a poor and large family and my husband has been unemployed for a long time; we have family expenses so we need resources to meet these,\" she added. But many rural women continue to face obstacles that undermine their opportunities for success, such as lack of public and social infrastructure, unequal access to credit, technical equipment and other important resources, like land and water. In Burkina Faso, Kenya, Tanzania and Zambia, for example, studies have shown that allocating land, labour, capital and fertilizer equally among men and women could increase agricultural production by between 10 and 20 percent. “Investing in better roads, transportation, electricity, water supply, childcare and health services is also key to reducing the time women spend on day-to-day unpaid work and can give them an opportunity to seize productive employment outside of the home,” says Eve Crowley, FAO’s Principal Advisor in the Gender, Equity and Rural Employment Division. This is particularly relevant in situations of environmental degradation or when the effects of HIV and AIDS and other diseases increase women’s household responsibilities and economic pressures, as they look after sick relatives and orphaned children. Education, skills development and technical training are likewise central to rural employment. They can help women-led businesses to expand their networks, to identify more lucrative markets with potential for employment and connect them to better growth opportunities. Female wage workers who are given equal opportunities in education and training are also more likely to compete favorably with men for quality jobs: “Women make up 20-30 percent of agricultural wage workers and often predominate in high-value industries for export - such as fresh fruits, vegetables and flowers. Although these non-traditional sectors of agriculture can present women with unprecedented income opportunities, we often find that women are hired on temporary or casual contracts to perform labour-intensive, manual tasks. They are given limited opportunities to acquire new skills and, overall, higher-level positions continue to be captured by men,” says Crowley. FAO in collaboration with the International Labour Organization (ILO) is working to identify new trends in rural labour markets and to ensure that gender-sensitive measures are integrated in the policy guidance that both agencies give at country level. “To fight hunger in the world we will need the energies of both men and women. Worldwide, rural women are key to food security: they make up a significant share of agricultural producers and play a crucial role in feeding their families and their nations,” she affirms. “Recognizing women’s contribution and taking into account their needs at all levels – in countries, in institutions and in policy – is therefore essential to increasing their productive capacities and to unleashing the greater contribution they can provide.”"

Rural women can reap numerous benefits from producers’ organizations. [FAO / S. Nelson] With the theme, Cooperative enterprise empowers women , the 2010 observance of the International Day of Cooperatives (3 July) puts the spotlight on how organizations can help women gain influence and access to the things they need to work more effectively - and improve well-being in their households and communities. As the lead UN agency in the fight against hunger and extreme poverty through agriculture and rural development, FAO works with producers’ organizations and cooperatives to reach both rural women and men who are small producers in agriculture and who, otherwise, might not gain access to the resources or services they need to improve their livelihoods. Much of the agricultural work done in smallholder households is performed by women, whether in female-headed or male-headed households. Yet, worldwide, women in agriculture are less likely than men to have access to land, equipment, credit, training and other tools which could help them to improve their food security and livelihoods. Eve Crowley, Deputy Director of FAO’s Gender, Equity and Rural Employment division, talks about the value of rural institutions and FAO’s activities in support of Producers’ Organizations (POs) and Cooperatives: Are producers’ cooperatives just for farmers? When we talk about producers we mean both men and women who are farmers, fishers, forest users, post-harvest operators, livestock groups and also workers’ groups. Why do small producers need cooperatives? Small producers are key to economic growth in most developing countries. They are more than half of all rural inhabitants. Some 1.5 billion women and men are in smallholder households. And their contribution to rural economies is significant because 40-60% percent of total rural incomes are produced by smallholders. They make a sizeable share of the transfers, wages and farm income in rural areas. But they also face certain barriers. The first and most important is their dispersion and small scale. Roughly 85% of farms worldwide are less than 2 hectares in size, so this creates a problem for small producers to access services, whether it’s information, infrastructure, or access to productive assets and markets. All of these things constitute high transaction costs for them. And they have limited representation in policy processes. How can cooperatives or producers’ organizations help rural women? Building and strengthening institutions like producers’ organizations and cooperatives that support or involve both women and men is one way to promote gender equality and the empowerment of women in agriculture. In addition, the establishment of women‐only cooperatives can be a valuable strategy for women to develop their own businesses, based on their economic and social needs and realities. In groups, producers are more efficient and effective, they have stronger bargaining power, they’re able to obtain a better quantity and quality of inputs, as well as to market a higher quantity and quality of outputs. Whether in women-only cooperatives or mixed groups, small producers are able to guarantee regularity and diversity in their production. They can also minimize the time and the risks and the costs involved, both in producing and in accessing services. How can producers’ organizations make rural development policies and programmers more effective? Producers’ organizations enable governments, international organizations like FAO and its UN partners, NGOs and others to provide support to rural women in more effective ways. When small producers, women or men, are dispersed, it’s very difficult for governments or donors to know how to reach them. But when they’re in organizations, they can benefit more effectively from capacity development support, service providers can reach them and do so more effectively. Buyers and investors can do so as well and other producers’ organizations, should there be a need to federate. Can you give us an example of how producers’ cooperatives have helped women? In the fisheries industry up and down the coast of West Africa, post-harvest operators - who handle fish processing and marketing responsibilities after the fish are caught - are overwhelmingly women. They dry, smoke, load and sell fish. In some countries, they sell salt and oysters at the market. But they have struggled to find the money, training and fish processing facilities to keep up with market standards and earn sufficient income. For donor and government assistance to be effective, it was not enough to help individuals in an ad hoc fashion. Through a project implemented in Cameroon, Chad, Senegal and The Gambia, FAO brought together women who knew what they needed but who lamented that they had frequently been excluded from decision-making boards and meetings within fisheries’ groups, even though they outnumbered men by far in coastal fish processing operations. The project is called the Sustainable Fisheries Livelihoods Programme Post-Harvest Fisheries Project. Here’s how it worked in The Gambia: Women organized themselves into legalized, village-based groups by work category, which also included men. They eventually grew into clusters of larger associations with national recognition. Throughout the process, the needs of both women and men were taken into consideration. The National Fisheries Post-Harvest Operators Platform, with about 1550 mostly female members, has signed agreements with government, NGOs, microfinance institutions and other development partners to receive assistance in information, guidance, services and technical support. The National Platform participated in the formulation of the 2007 Fisheries Act, which recognizes the importance of artisanal fisheries to the economy. As a result of the Platform’s activities, the country’s poverty reduction strategy now includes post-harvest issues in fisheries. What are some of the practical results of the assistance received by the women’s organization? The women enhanced their activities with credit schemes provided to all members at more affordable rates and are now sharing communal, renovated fish-processing facilities on a pay-as-you-go system. The women now have new fish-smoking houses and better equipment. The renovation of eight, and construction of two newly built, fish smoking houses and drying racks for the women has enhanced their productive capacities, reduced post-harvest losses and improved the quality of fish produce. The women also received training in how more effective processing and hygiene can help them to preserve and sell more of what is caught. They are more aware of such issues as sustainable fisheries management, waste collection and hygiene in processing and storage. One important point: The women received functional literacy training, which was necessary for more effective participation in decision-making. These groups are considered a prime example of the importance of giving women a direct say in what measures are needed for them to improve their livelihoods, and supporting their efforts to contribute to institutions that influence national and regional agriculture from the bottom up."

Farmers in Cambodia harvesting rice seedlings. [FAO/A.K. Kimoto] In Cambodia , female-headed households have access to about 21 percent less land than male-headed households, while in Lao PDR and Vietnam ; they have 16 and 27 percent less land, respectively. These details were among those included in profiles published after nearly one year of re-tabulation and analysis of existing government census data and other statistics. Technical and financial support for the initiative came from a strategic partnership between FAO and Sida , the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency. The initiative, Strengthening National Capacities for Socially- and Sex-Disaggregated Data in Agriculture and Rural Development (SDD project), addressed the need for high quality, reliable statistical data gathered according to sex and age for the food and agriculture sector – data that could help the Asia-Pacific region to more effectively target agricultural and rural development policies and programmes. The profiles showed that in Vietnam, less than a tenth of all commercial farms were owned by female-headed households. And in the mountain-plateau zone of Cambodia, the average land size of female-headed households was up to 54 percent smaller than in male-headed households, leading female-headed households to produce up to 8 times less rice. While the profiles looked closely at access to land, crops produced, access to equipment and other resources for use in farming, fisheries and forestry, some of the data also looked at a broader range of economic and social details that could provide information on gender in agricultural households. These areas included access to financial services; literacy and educational level; available technology and training; communication sources, and access to food, drinking water and sanitation. The tables revealed gender inequalities in access to productive resources, as well as basic amenities and social services. In Laos, women had fewer alternative income and loan opportunities, spent a greater portion of their total expenditures on food purchases, and had less access to safe drinking water than men. In Vietnam, statistics also showed a disparity in access to financial services. Proportionally fewer female-headed households accessed loans – 24 percent compared to 33 percent in male-headed households. In Laos, 9 percent fewer women than men had completed primary school, while in Cambodia, the proportion of educated males in agricultural households was 10 percent higher than that of female members. The country profiles were created during the process of developing, testing and finalizing a Gender and Agricultural Statistics Framework (GASF), which is designed to guide both producers and users of statistics through a series of standard stages for producing sex-disaggregated data. The stages include identification of gender and agriculture issues to investigate, the listing of relevant statistics or indicators, the identification of appropriate data sources, and the re-tabulation and analysis of existing data according to sex. GASF was designed to be used by countries worldwide and is compatible with the World Programme for the Census of Agriculture (WCA) and FAO statistical frameworks like FAOSTAT and CountrySTAT. It draws on several existing frameworks and toolkits designed for gender and poverty analysis and the collection of agricultural statistics. The GASF was developed in recognition of the multi-faceted approach needed in order to document women’s roles in agriculture and gender disparities in access to productive resources. Government ministries in Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam have indicated that they plan to incorporate the GASF in planning and analyzing the next round of agricultural censuses."

      "article_text": "Improving social and economic conditions for rural people is one of the keys to tackling child labour. So is reducing the exploitation of girls and boys in agriculture. An FAO study in Ghana looks at the issue. Child labour in small-scale agriculture poses special challenges [FAO/J. Spaull] Spraying toxic pesticides, working long hours without attending school, or being forced to exchange sex for money or food. Tens of millions of children working in agriculture worldwide face these and other hazardous or unacceptable conditions. Agriculture, including fishing, ranks as one of the three most hazardous professions in the world and accounts for 70 percent of child labour worldwide. In Ghana, half the rural children and about one-fifth of the urban children were found to be economically active in 2001, the last year for which there are national figures. Nearly 60 percent of them were engaged in agriculture, forestry and fishing. Ghana was chosen for the study, Child Labour and Children’s Economic Activities in Agriculture in Ghana , in part because it was possible to analyze the impact of anti-child labour measures taken in Ghana. The government, non-governmental organizations and unions there had already begun implementing policies to reduce the worst forms of labour, and it was expected that other countries would be able to benefit from lessons learned and good practices documented in the study. The six-month study, conducted in 2008, reviewed literature, legislation and practices related to child labour in Ghana, in collaboration with Humboldt University in Berlin. It focused on the identification of major legislation, institutions, policies and processes affecting the economic activities of children and child labour and included case studies in cocoa production, fishing, and cattle herding. Lessons learned in Ghana Research showed that many children were deprived of basic, compulsory schooling. Cattle boys in the districts of Tolon-Kumbungu and North and South Tongu herded cattle from morning to evening without being enrolled in school. There were reports of child trafficking in cattle herding and fishing, and evidence of hazardous working conditions in all sectors. In cocoa production, surveys in Ghana showed that children’s economic activities ranged from light, acceptable work to what could be considered hazardous activity, but also that the line between acceptable work and child labour was not always clear-cut. In June 2008, the Ministry of Manpower, Youth and Employment released a Hazardous Child Labour Activity Framework for the cocoa sector to clarify the definition of acceptable work and child labour, as defined in ILO conventions, and assist stakeholders in distinguishing the two. The Ministry catalogued specific activities considered hazardous for children, including working in isolation on a farm, using machetes, felling trees and using pesticides. In addition, the number of working hours and education opportunities were taken into account. The latter was especially relevant for girls, who worldwide are less likely to meet compulsory schooling requirements due to the double-burden of household responsibilities and economic activities outside of the home. “Working on the farm or on the fishing boat or herding cattle can, if it doesn’t get in the way of school and occurs under safe circumstances, be very valuable. It’s a means of acquiring skills, giving kids a sense of belonging and cultural identity,” said Bernd Seiffert, FAO Rural Livelihoods and Local Institutions Officer. Seeking change in small-scale work environments One of the key issues reflected in the Ghanaian study was the challenge of addressing child labour in small scale agricultural environments and in particular, fishing communities. “Child labour in fishing mostly takes place in the small scale fishing environments and not on the large-scale vessels. Often these fishing communities have high levels of poverty and there are very few perceived options for alternative income strategies,” said Seiffert. “One of the approaches that works is offering incentives like cash, in-kind transfers, or access to credit that is linked to school attendance. This has to go along with close monitoring of school attendance, very clear technical support, mentoring, psychological support in some cases, of the children and their parents or guardians. Also, providing school feeding has proven to be a very effective way of keeping children in school,” Seiffert added. “Another issue is to closely examine the quality and relevance of local education and to promote education and learning that is relevant for children’s future livelihoods. This is where FAO’s Junior Farmer Field and Life Schools (JFFLS) can be very helpful,” said Seiffert. The JFFLS approach, present in several member countries, uses trained extension workers, teachers and social animators, and a participatory methodology, to pass on agricultural knowledge and life skills to boys and girls between the ages of 12 and 17. Main recommendations In addition to highlighting practices in Ghana that help to reduce child labour, the study recommended FAO, ILO and other partners step up technical support for Ghana’s efforts to integrate child labour concerns into its national fisheries policy, as well as its agricultural and fisheries extension services. It also called on support to the government in incorporating information or questions on working children into Ghana’s national surveys. Globally, it was recommended that FAO mirror these priorities by working with partners to mainstream child labour issues into the work of its different departments at headquarters and in decentralized offices, and boost the availability of information, educational materials, and training. It was recommended that FAO support governments’ efforts to establish databases on children’s economic activities in agriculture, linking these efforts to those of existing initiatives, such as Understanding Children’s Work , an inter-agency research project by the ILO, UNICEF and the World Bank. Because of its mandate and its close working relationships with national ministries and departments of agriculture, FAO was seen as a potential centre - together with the ILO - for information and knowledge on child labour in agriculture and fishing, and a necessary actor in efforts to reduce child labour while promoting rural development."

      "article_text": "Evictions, confiscation of property and discrimination are among the experiences increasingly reported by widows and orphans in Mozambique. An FAO-commissioned report offers recommendations to secure women’s and children’s rights to property and inheritan In Mozambique, widows and orphans are at increased risk of losing access to land, housing, and other property [FAO/G. Bizzarri] Many women and children in sub-Saharan Africa have long experienced insecure rights to property and inheritance. But in some countries, the situation is being exacerbated by early deaths from disease and conflict, as well as the loss of the extended family support systems that once functioned as social safety nets for widows and orphaned children. This is the case in Mozambique. Despite recent economic growth, Mozambique remains one of the poorest countries in the world. This, combined with the severe impact of HIV and AIDS, has had a serious impact on food security and the socio-economic well-being of rural families. Although AIDS-related deaths in Mozambique are declining, they increased from 10.3 percent to 12.5 between 2001 and 2007. Amid the AIDS epidemic, many widows and children have been unable to inherit, or protect their inheritance of, land, livestock, housing and agricultural tools. This has left them without access to the basic means to sustain their livelihoods and avoid extreme poverty and hunger. Widows in Mozambique have told of being evicted from their houses or run off their land by their late husbands’ relatives. They have recounted how relatives have removed cattle, bicycles and other assets of value from their households. Orphaned children who have lost both parents have reported seeing relatives take much of their parents’ property from them. Often, the families that were supposed to take care of the orphans discriminated against them, providing them with less nourishment and schooling. The FAO-commissioned report, Children and women’s rights to property and inheritance in Mozambique , is based on research conducted from 2006 to 2007 by Save the Children. While the report says revamping national laws can help to protect the property rights of women and children, it also stresses the “urgent need to look beyond legal arguments and consider the community and cultural contexts as well.” In Mozambique, for example, inheritance issues, and disputes over property, are seen by many as private, family matters. This kind of cultural information should be taken into account when dealing with property grabbing from widows or orphaned children. Despite strong condemnation of individual cases of property grabbing from widows or orphaned children, there has been little active opposition from community members or leaders who do not want to interfere unless asked. Also, relatives tend to go unpunished when they grab property from children, as adults often do not perceive a need to account for their acts towards children. The report advocates sensitizing and building the capacity of judges, religious leaders, traditional healers and other leaders in the community to address challenges related to women’s and children’s property rights. As actors most likely to be involved in local conflict resolution, community leaders and judges are in the position to ensure recognition of both formal and customary laws, and to try to reconcile the two in mediation with family councils or in community courts, where inheritance disputes are most commonly handled. The report was produced as a resource for government institutions, non-governmental organizations and community-based organizations, and is based on research conducted in four provinces of Mozambique in 2006-07. Its main purpose is to propose possible entry points for interventions, key messages and activities aimed at improving women’s and children’s property and inheritance rights and access. In addition to capacity building, the report recommends revising national property rights and inheritance laws; encouraging families to make out wills and put legal documents like birth certificates and land deeds in order; expanding paralegal assistance for victims of property grabbing; and boosting communication and education of community members, including children. The report recommends pointing out to community members that tradition calls for the care and protection of widows and orphaned children, and that women need access to land and property to support their livelihoods, and to take care of their children. It also recommends that family members who assume care of orphaned children also be the ones administering their inheritance, to ensure that it sustains and educates the children. Ultimately, increasing awareness of the benefits of protecting widows’ and orphans’ property rights would help entire communities by boosting the potential of women and children to contribute to social and economic development."

      "article_text": "Chicken-raising collectives, water-harvesting systems and community-based savings and credit schemes are some of the strategies that women’s groups have used to boost food production and incomes, showing themselves to be indispensable in the fight against Coping strategies, knowledge of women producers key to large-scale improvements in rural development [FAO/G. Napolitano] Despite the devastating effects of the recent food and economic crises, women in vulnerable rural communities worldwide have drawn on their adaptability, resilience and mutual support to come up with effective coping strategies, a report prepared for FAO shows. The report, “Supporting women producers to respond to the challenges of food insecurity,” summarizes face-to-face consultations conducted with hundreds of women in 23 countries. FAO and its partners in the research project, the Huairou Commission and WOCAN , presented the paper during the 1-12 March meeting of the UN Commission on the Status of Women . The idea was to give rural women in developing countries a chance to have their voices heard in the global dialogue on food security. The women, from 24 grassroots organizations in Africa, Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, said food insecurity in their communities had grown worse amid recent economic pressures, climate change, a shortage of decent employment in rural areas, and a chronic lack of control over, land, water and other productive resources. By organizing themselves into groups, the women had combined their collective determination and organizational skills with practical knowledge of local natural resources and traditional agricultural methods. Together, they improved the availability of nutritious food, boosted small-scale agriculture, and generated alternative income. In Asia, women developed water harvesting projects and made irrigation systems more accessible, thus reducing their vulnerability to drought. Rural groups worked together to develop communal kitchens in Peru, chicken-raising collectives in Jamaica, and community-based savings and credit groups in Nepal. In Ghana, farmers shared tractor-related expenses. Some women described pooling their resources to obtain seeds and successfully bargain for cheaper prices from farmers or shops. With the help of larger associations, some rural groups gained training in improved technologies for irrigation, seed storage, food processing, marketing and eco-friendly packaging. But the women said they still lacked access to the most basic means necessary to ensure food security for themselves and their families. While the findings differed slightly from region to region due to cultural, political and economic contexts, the rural women surveyed perceived many of the same causes of food security in their communities. They typically listed a complex combination of factors, including high food prices; climate change and degradation of local biodiversity and seed supplies; lack of access to land and water; privatization of land, and use of land for biofuels. Climate change cast a pall over communities in every region. In Cameroon, one woman farmer wrote, “We are confused about the climate and we do not know when to plant.” In Tanzania, Maasai women were unable to sell enough milk from their cattle when drought led the animals to produce less milk. One of the major gaps which took a greater toll on rural women than their male counterparts was the lack of land rights or practical control over land and water resources. Even in cases where national constitutions recognized their rights to land, conflicting laws or customary practices often denied women the right to own or inherit land. In Nepal, women said they feared that “without land, we will die of hunger.” A woman in Kenya said that women needed loans to buy land, adding that it had been “a tradition for the issues of land to be a preserve of men,” but that women could “do a lot more if given the same opportunities like men.” In speaking out about the challenges they face, the women were quick to say what they need to be able to feed themselves and their families and to improve their prospects for a better future.

      "article_text": "A new database launched by FAO puts the spotlight on one of the major stumbling blocks to rural development – widespread inequalities between men and women in their access to land. Gender equality in access to land can boost food security [FAO/A. Benedetti] The Gender and Land Rights Database , produced in consultation with national statistics authorities, universities, civil society organizations and other sources worldwide, offers up-to-date information on how men and women in 78 countries differ in their legal rights and access to land. In most of the world, women lag well behind men in ownership of agricultural land and access to income from land, even though women are major producers of food crops and play crucial roles in providing and caring for their households. “Disparity in land access is one of the major causes for social and economic inequalities between males and females in rural areas. It jeopardizes food security at the household and community levels, and has an impact on national food security and development. It is vital information for policy makers. But until now, finding information on this phenomenon in one place has been difficult to come by,” Marcela Villarreal, Director, FAO Gender, Equity and Rural Employment Division said as the new database was placed online. The new information tool, available to anyone with access to the Internet, provides policymakers and other users with a better picture of the major social, economic, political and cultural factors which affect access to land and enforcement of women’s land rights. The database covers both national and customary laws governing land use; property rights and inheritance; international treaties and conventions; land tenure and related institutions; civil society organizations that work on land issues, and other related statistics. By searching country profiles, users can find out the answers to specific questions on topics like the total number of land holders, the total number of women land holders and the number of rural households headed by women. They can also call up comparisons on a given topic between two or more countries. “Decision-makers at all levels now have, on the one hand, a comprehensive source of information on the more relevant factors affecting the equality of land rights in their countries and, on the other hand, the possibility to make comparisons between trends and situations in their own and other countries,” FAO Gender and Development Research Officer Zoraida Garcia said. “They can then use this information to tailor their own decisions and strategies, but also to have a clearer idea of the possible impacts which those strategies might have on the real economic empowerment of women, and on the well-being of rural communities,” she added. “FAO had so many requests on a regular basis from member states and others in the international community who wanted to understand how gender disparities affected and were impacted by the land tenure situation. That’s why we developed this tool, to help provide a comprehensive view of the issue,” Garcia explained. It was a positive sign that countries recognized gender and land rights as a “core issue” on the development agenda, Garcia added. Customary norms, religious beliefs and social practices that influence gender-differentiated land rights: 1. Traditional authorities and customary institutions 2. Inheritance/succession de facto practices 3. Discrepancies/gaps between statutory and customary laws. One of the key patterns seen in the database, said Garcia, is the great gulf between formal rights and practice. In many cases, national constitutions acknowledge men and women have equal rights to land, but the day-to-day reality is very different. Often, those rights are jeopardized by conflicting laws or long-standing traditional and institutional practices which assign land titles and inheritance to males or the man’s side of the family. As it grows, the Gender and Land Rights Database will incorporate suggestions from users and feedback on how specific information has been used in national dialogues on land use, gender and agricultural and rural development."

A selection of viewpoints... \"When you put a project in women's hands, women deliver\" [FAO/G.Bizzarri] Analucy Bengochea is coordinator of the Garifuna Emergency Committee, which was formed in 1998 after Hurricane Mitch devastated the Garifuna indigenous community in north-eastern Honduras. Our committee recently held a consultation with rural communities in Honduras and found that families are now eating only two meals a day. From what we see, the economic crisis has brought greater poverty and increased food insecurity. Many farmers grow food for the family and have very little left to sell. Women farmers are in a very difficult situation - they cannot grow crops because they have no land or money. They need loans, but the banks demand guarantees they can't give. In many cases, women find themselves as heads of their households because the men have left to find work elsewhere. The responsibility of women keeps increasing as they have to find ways to feed and educate their children. There are no public policies that reward all this work that women are doing. Nowadays, hunger is not just a problem of rural communities. It is a problem in all areas of society, at a global level. It is important that farmers, indigenous people, governments, and donors learn to work together. It is also important that all groups are represented in decision-making because nobody can decide for anyone else if they do not know what their reality is. We need food security programmes that deal directly with rural and indigenous women. All rural and agricultural communities have leaders. These communities have functioning structures that have survived over time, and it is important to work with them. When you put a project in the hands of women, women deliver. Through the grassroots consultations, we were able to meet with farmers in Central America to share and compare different strategies and ideas, especially on crops, organic fertilizers and family gardens. For example, I learned that Guatemala uses organic fertilizers, so we adopted it in Honduras, while they learnt from our experience with seed banks. We try to use every experience that can be applied in our countries. At a government administrative level, the good practices emerging in the communities should be institutionalized. The change is emerging from the people in our own countries. We need to encourage new public policies that protect our environment, eliminate food insecurity and promote education. Gódavari Dange is a farmer from Maharashtra and leader of the Sakhi Federation Network, one of 5 000 women's groups assisted by the Indian learning and development NGO Swayam Shikshan Prayog. We did a study which found that women in our area were very anaemic and not eating properly. When we asked the women why they were so anaemic, they said they had to serve food to all the family first, before they could sit down to eat. By that time, there was not much food left. So we did a large educational programme for women on how they should take care of their own health and explained that if they did not give importance to food, they would always get sick. Agriculture is the sole source of income for most women in our area. But working alone, women farmers suffer from a lack of information, and have little say in what to grow. But working in groups, women are able to benefit. For example, the rains this year were supposed to come in June, but they came in August. The women's groups quickly changed their cultivation plans and switched to \"short\" vegetables for 30 days. We funded women to travel and go around as teachers and conduct training for other women in this knowledge. Through the grassroots consultations, we share experiences among women – for example, what is practiced in Nepal or in Sri Lanka. We collect all kinds of experiences, and then we share with the government officials our experiences and our recommendations on what we think they should do. When they see a large group of women, government officials talk more easily about their plans. It is only when we women travel outside our own countries that we can see the problems of others and take information back home. For example, HIV seriously affects our area, but we've not really been looking at it that way. When we visited Kenya, we learned some things and saw how the Kenyans and the African Union worked on HIV and AIDS. So, we started our work and now we have more than 50 women focusing on that issue. We've had problems with men who were not allowing the women to join grassroots networks. But the situation is changing because it is women who are now accessing resources, not the men. When women have control over resources, men respect them. A farmer and member of the Katuba Women's Association in northwest Zambia, Florence Shakafuswa attended two grassroots consultations for women. I got involved with the grassroots consultations through my association. I attended a consultation in Ghana where we learned about the value of paralegal training. Access to land is a big issue for women in Zambia. But many women are not aware of the steps to go through to apply for recognition of land rights. At the grassroots consultation, women with paralegal training were able to explain to us some of the basic steps. I would like to see the grassroots consultations continue because we're learning a lot from other women's experiences. In Zambia, even at the very top level, there are few women who are ministers, and that trickles down to the lower levels. Women do not have the confidence to speak out for themselves. Sometimes women have to hide from their men the fact that they are coming to meetings of women's groups. In a lot of cases, resentment or suspicion towards women leads to violence and harassment. Women need leadership skills and we need to work together with men. Sometimes, men recognize that women are important for food security. They'll find food at home and some of them won't even question where the food is coming from. And yet, they'll eat that food and recognize that this woman has made it possible for them to have that meal. So, men are slowly realizing that women can do a lot of other things that are important to men as well. Men are the ones distributing seed and fertilizer. We would like women to be part of the distribution because the women who need it are being passed over. So it's not enough to say, \"Go and help these women in the community\". It's a matter of who is making the decisions, who is handling the assistance. I think rural women's ideas and initiatives have to be reflected in policies by involving women earlier in the decision-making and policy making process. Nereide Segala Coelho is a member of Rede Pintadas, a development forum in the Brazilian state of Bahia that brings together local government, women farmers' groups, agricultural cooperatives and other NGOs. Before I became involved with the grassroots consultations, I thought it was only Rede Pintadas, in one isolated municipality, that was discussing food insecurity, rights to water, marketing problems and working conditions. Now I know that rural women all over the world face similar issues. My husband and I have one hectare of land where we grow crops and produce milk from three cows. Our land is in a semi-arid area, one of the poorest in Brazil. The work is labour-intensive because we do practically everything with our bare hands. In our area, land usually belongs to men. The only government programme that helps rural women directly is an endowment given to low-income women on condition that their children go to school. But that income is not enough to allow a woman to take bank loans. Men are usually the first to have access to credit. When the woman tries to get a loan, she finds that what she \"owns\" has already been pledged as collateral by her husband. So, a woman farmer needs, first, the right to own land. She also needs access to resources so that she can produce. For example, it is difficult for us to make cheese or yoghurt – to enter the market, I have to pasteurize our milk at a plant 36 km away from our farm. But we don't have refrigeration to store our milk, so by the time we have enough to process, it has gone bad. We have had other problems with selling beef and veal. It took us two years to get approval from health authorities to market our meat, and without refrigeration we can't store it. Recently, we women have been discussing storage, product processing, and marketing of products that come from our agriculture. But we need to change consumer behaviour. When children at school were asked where their food came from, they all said \"from the supermarket\". None of them said \"from the Earth, from the Pacha Mama \". If we want to cultivate and preserve our agricultural practices, it is essential to include agriculture in the school system. If not, our children will grow up with an urban mentality. So now we have started a big project with young people to help them understand that everything we have comes from agriculture."

      "article_text": "The complex interrelationship between bioenergy and food security, and the challenges posed by the growing demand for food and fuel in an increasingly carbon-constrained world Brazil: Production of sugarcane for ethanol [FAO/G. Bizzarri] by Andrea Rossi and Yianna Lambrou Growing global demand for liquid biofuels may affect three dimensions of food security – availability, access and stability. Large-scale plantations for liquid biofuel production (LBP), with their high input requirements, may divert land and other resources, such as water, away from food crops. In addition, these plantations, due to their high profitability, may be established on high-quality lands, reducing the availability of such lands for growing food and subsistence crops. The potential loss of agro-biodiversity poses a serious threat to rural livelihoods and long-term food security as well. LBP may also have a negative impact on the livestock sector, which is key to the food security of rural households, through a reduction in the availability of grazing land and an increase in the price of livestock feed due to the growing use of agricultural commodities for LBP. All these factors, combined, might negatively affect food availability. At the same time, liquid biofuel production has an impact on food access. The emerging liquid biofuel industry is a new, fast growing source of demand for agricultural commodities such as sugar, maize, oilseeds, palm oil and cassava. This, combined with other factors such as income and population growth, adverse weather conditions, and new or additional trade barriers and export restrictions, has contributed to higher food prices. Some studies have tried to measure the impact of LBP on food prices, reaching different conclusions. According to IFPRI's estimates, in 2000-2007 increased demand for liquid biofuels has contributed to 30% of the growth of cereal prices, calculated as a weighted average. Demand for agricultural commodities for food, feed and, in particular, fuel is expected to continue to increase rapidly in the future. OECD/IEA estimates that, between 2008 and 2017, 20% of world vegetable oil production and 13% of world coarse grain production could shift to liquid biofuel production, up from 9% and 8% in 2007. Regarding the future impact of liquid biofuels on food prices, IFPRI projects that, in 2020, real prices of oilseeds and maize will be 18 and 26% higher than in the scenario with LBP at 2007 levels. According to OECD/IEA, current biofuel support measures alone are expected to increase average vegetable oil prices by about 19%, maize by around 7% and wheat by about 5% in 2008-2017. Higher food prices represent an opportunity for food-exporting developing countries, which can enjoy increased export revenues; similarly, at the household level, net producers of food stand to benefit from increased food prices, through a positive income effect, which might result in an increase in food access for these households. Forty-three of the 52 Least Developed Countries (LDCs), however, are net importers of food. Significant increases in food prices threaten the trade balance and, more in general, the macroeconomic stability and overall economic growth of these countries, which will also struggle to meet domestic food demand17. According to OECD/FAO, projections show greatly increased vulnerability and uncertain food supplies for these countries, due to high commodity prices and high price volatility. As increases in food prices are transmitted from the global to the local markets, households that are net purchasers of food, particularly those that are also at risk of being excluded from LBP, such as female-headed households, will be negatively affected as well. Most households in LDCs and particularly Low Income Food Deficit Countries fall into the category of net food purchasers. In Malawi and Bangladesh, for instance, only 11.8 and 15.7% of households, respectively, are net staple food sellers, with higher percentages in rural areas and lower in urban areas. Among poor rural households with less than a dollar a day, the percentage of net sellers is even lower: 8.6 in Bangladesh and 7.6 in Malawi. Poor rural households spend 50 to 70% of their budget on food. In addition, in low-income households, staple food commodities such as corn and wheat account for a larger share of food expenditures. Access to food might be considerably reduced for these households. In addition, higher food prices reduce the purchasing power of net-food-buyer households, affecting the purchase of other goods and services such as drinking water, health care, education, and lighting, all of which represent important inputs into nutrition and are, at the same time, key to the welfare and health of household members. The welfare losses or gains associated with food price increases do not seem to be equally distributed among female-headed households and male-headed households. According to FAO, in most national, rural and urban samples, female-headed households suffer greater proportional welfare losses - or benefit from smaller proportional welfare gains - than male-headed households. This is the case both for the population as a whole and for the poorest segments of it. Where female-headed households are over-represented among the poor, or are more likely to be poor, it is expected that their welfare losses will be higher, due to the fact that poorer households spend a greater percentage of their incomes on food than richer ones. However, even when male-headed households are over-represented among the poor, female-headed households may still have greater welfare losses, such as in Nicaragua. This is due to two main factors. Firstly, it has been observed, in many different contexts, that, all else equal, women tend to spend on food a greater share of their income than men. Secondly, as was already discussed, female-headed households have less access to land, capital, technology and markets than men and thus are less able to participate in commercial agricultural production and to benefit from an increase in the price of agricultural commodities. Finally, the rising demand for liquid biofuels could make the prices of food more unstable. This would have negative repercussions in particular for poor households and vulnerable groups, including women, which tend to be particularly exposed to chronic and transitory food insecurity, due also to their limited access to income-generating activities."

      "article_text": "Farming women may grow lower-value subsistence crops not because they prefer to, but because they cannot access the resources that would permit them to do otherwise If horticulture becomes profitable, men may take over [G. Napolitano/FAO] by Sabine Guendel Cash and export crops are frequently regarded as \"men's crops\" and subsistence crops as \"women's crops\". The standard explanation for this division is that women are responsible for feeding the family and thus prefer to grow subsistence crops for the household, whereas men are responsible for providing cash income and thus raise cash and export crops. In general, however, it is difficult to tell whether women grow lower-value subsistence crops because they have different preferences and concerns or because they cannot access the land, inputs, credit, information, and markets that would permit them to do otherwise. In Ghana, for instance, women farmers view maize production as a productive, income-generating activity yet refrain from growing maize because they lack the capital to purchase the required inputs or hire someone to plough the fields. Instead they continue cultivating cassava and yams, which require fewer external inputs. Numerous time allocation studies have examined which household members perform which farm tasks. These studies often identify some tasks as men's tasks and others as women's tasks. For example, in Kenya women reported that men were responsible for building the granary and women were clearly responsible for hand digging, harvesting, and transporting the crops. Although many tasks may be viewed as exclusively women's or men's, in practice the divisions are blurred, and both men and women are involved. Relatively few tasks are done only by men or only by women. That women throughout Africa tend to provide more labour for agriculture than men—and almost always provide more total labour—has implications for technology adoption. Even if they know they can increase productivity, women may be unable to increase the number of hours that they spend working. Simple comparisons of hours worked do not capture issues related to the type of work being done and the energy expended. The value of time will vary by season and task. Thus, people will be interested in saving the time that is the most costly. However, to the extent that the tasks vary by gender and the value of women's time is lower, farmers may be more inclined to adopt technologies that save men's time. The gender division of labour appears to change in response to changing economic opportunities. When men leave agricultural communities in search of higher earnings, women assume many traditionally \"men's tasks\". Men usually move into traditionally \"women's crop activities\" when those activities are perceived as having become more productive or profitable. Women in Burkina Faso traditionally picked shea nuts, for example, but now that sales of shea nuts are profitable, men are becoming involved, often with the assistance of their wives. Another factor behind changes in labour allocation for different tasks is the adoption of new technologies. For instance, the mechanization of \"women's tasks\" may cause men to take greater control of those tasks. The extent to which these changes benefit or disadvantage women and men is not always clear, and it is difficult to predict a priori what changes will occur. Research and extension systems can become more effective in developing sustainable crop production systems if they adopt a gender perspective that heightens their understanding of the distinct roles, needs and opportunities of different household members. Many studies show that men and women have different preferences and criteria for choosing among crops and varieties and performing such activities as selecting seed, cultivating, harvesting, and processing. Because women tend to manage complex farming systems, they have developed multiple assessment criteria for crop system performance, encompassing risk minimization, vulnerability and other objectives that must be considered in promoting innovations. Local knowledge of men and women farmers is an important asset in innovation and technology development, especially for such key crop production issues as seed management, plant breeding, crop protection, and soil fertility management. Understanding gender differences in local knowledge and recognizing the contribution women can make in this field are important, because women are more frequently involved in traditional farming practices. Knowledge difference can reveal important opportunities to contribute to crop improvement or crop and variety selection. Knowledge differences must also be understood to improve the effectiveness of any technology dissemination or extension process. Information—appropriate information, given and received on a timely basis—is critical to the development and use of technical innovations and improvements, yet women frequently cannot obtain such information. Agricultural research and development, including extension services, have been dominated by men and have largely ignored women's role in crop production and have not focused on women's needs for technology and information. Social norms and cultural practices can prevent women from participating in development interventions or information campaigns. Using more appropriate information channels is one way to address this situation. Another strategy is to provide more relevant information by specifically addressing gender aspects of crop production. Over the last two centuries, societies have invested considerably in complex institutional arrangements to advance technological innovation in agriculture. Many of these institutions have overlooked women and have marginalized women farmers in terms of technology adoption. Gender-responsive actions should enable women farmers to take greater advantage of extension systems and increase the accessibility of new agricultural technologies and innovations. Organizational innovations, such as participatory research, farmer-extension linkages, and strengthening the linkages between formal and local seed systems, can improve women's livelihood outcomes by ensuring that technologies meet their needs."

      "article_text": "Poverty often pushes women into off-farm employment, which can make a critical difference in the poverty status of their households. How much a woman benefits depends on how her new income is distributed Labourers pick tea on the slopes of Mount Goalpara, Indonesia [J. Micaud] by Marzia Fontana , with Cristina Paciello The linkages between employment, poverty and gender inequality are complex and require an understanding of how household dynamics and labour market processes inter-act. The relationship between poverty and women's employment runs in both directions. Poverty can push women into employment – the so called \"distress sale of labour\", often in informal and poorly paid jobs. On the other hand, women's income from employment often makes a critical difference in the poverty status of their households. However, this does not necessarily mean that the individual situation of the woman concerned improves, because household income may not be distributed according to the amount of time each member contributes to its generation. Attention should be given to separating out individual from average household well-being impacts, which may differ because of unequal distribution of rights, resources and time between genders. Policies for rural employment and development must give due consideration to women's bargaining position both in the household and in the labour market. Poverty is linked to weaker incorporation in both. In most developing countries, women often seek wage employment in response to economic crises and difficult family circumstances, such as separation and widowhood. Agricultural casual wage work often appears to be the only available employment option for poor rural women (more than for poor rural men). Because they are crowded in a limited number of occupations and lack start-up assets, poor women enter the bargaining process with their employers in a weak position. Vulnerability may force them to sell their labour well below market rates. Evidence from Southern Africa corroborates these patterns. In Mozambique, a high share of female wage labourers are single heads of households. In-depth interviews indicate that women who are widows or divorced have greater difficulties in accessing decent jobs. Their weak bargaining position means that they often have to accept irregular wages and receive few, if any, benefits. Evidence from South Asia shows that rural women from poorer households are more likely to take up paid employment, particularly as wage workers, than women from wealthier families. For example, in Pakistan, women from landless households, or from sharecropping households, have higher levels of participation in agricultural waged labour and work longer hours than women in landowning households. Women's employment income can make a critical difference in the poverty status of their households. A much quoted study for Ghana and Uganda shows that poverty rates for female-headed households engaged in non-farm activities declined faster than poverty rates for other households. In Ghana, for instance, female-headed households combining both farm and non-farm work experienced a 37% decline in poverty compared with a 14% decline for male-headed households with similar characteristics over the 1987–1992 period. The study finds that women in Ghana are more involved in non-farm activities than in farming, while the reverse holds for Uganda. In both countries high shares of non–farm employment performed by women are associated with higher overall household income. This suggests that the ability of women to diversify out of agriculture may provide an effective pathway out of poverty. However, these findings should be taken with caution as the time period over which changes were analysed is rather short (and the study quite old). A study in Viet Nam offers similar findings. Rural women's ability to diversify out of farming was more strongly associated with household well-being than that of men's. Diversification into off-farm activities, rather than diversity per se, explained higher levels of household income. The study also suggests that, despite women's longer hours of work in domestic and childcare activities, marginal returns to their off–farm activities were similar to those of men. All these findings are very context-specific and more and sounder evidence is needed to substantiate these claims. Rural non-farm work can be very diverse and female members of the poorest household may be lacking the resources to participate in the most profitable activities. When household income increases as a result of women taking up paid employment, this does not necessarily mean that the individual situation of the woman concerned improves at the same time. For instance, a study in Kenya shows that increased participation of women in sugar production brought about significant income gains in overall household income and food consumption. However, women's direct control over income from the new cash crop was much less than that of men. Increases in women's own income were associated with decreases in their body mass index, because additional work and greater energy intensity of activities exceeded the concurrent increase in their caloric intake. As for the impact on other household members, substantial evidence shows that women's access to economic resources increases the share of household expenditures devoted to \"public goods\" and is more beneficial to households' well-being (in particular the well-being of children) than income earned by men. However the impact of women's access to paid labour more specifically is more mixed because of the presence of two opposite effects: a positive effect due to an increase in household income associated with mothers' paid work and a negative effect due to a possible decline in the time devoted to housework and childcare. These considerations suggest that attention needs to be paid to the type of employment obtained by women and the intensity of their work."

Household resources tend to be reallocated in favour of cash crop intensification, which may undermine household food production and the role traditionally held by women in being primarily responsible for family food security.

      "article_text": "For small scale farmers, the benefits of agricultural commercialization can carry \"significant economic and social costs\" A farming woman and daughter in Honduras [FAO/G. Bizzarri] by Zoraida García Small farmers in developing countries – and women farmers in particular – are increasingly excluded from the emerging globalized food economy. Smallholders are typically among the poorest of the rural population. Constraints historically faced by rural women (usually among marginalized groups in rural areas who lack access to productive resources), hold them back from adopting new technologies, increasing their economies of scale or more fully participating in marketing channels higher upstream. Trends indicate that smaller farmers in developing countries are increasingly abandoning or selling farms, leading to land concentration and expanded commercial crop production. Two recent examples from Latin America point to ways in which the concentration of production and processing tends to exclude smallholders from agriculture. More than 60 000 small dairy farmers in Brazil have abandoned the sector, unable to lower transaction costs and remain competitive under consolidated retail and processing outputs. In Guatemala, where glutted wholesale vegetable markets are giving way to an emerging consolidated food service, one successful farmer cooperative experienced a severe reduction in tomato producers, from 330 down to six in just one year. Cooperative members surviving the consolidation purchased land from those forced to exit. A strong gender imbalance is fostered by this process of agricultural transformation and concentration of production and resources, as most women farmers tend to hold small-scale and family farms while men, more likely to own medium-sized or large scale commercial farms, are in a better position to capitalize on the expansion of agricultural tradable goods. Although increased trade may promote investment, and the development of large-scale commercial farming and cash crops for export, it threatens household subsistence farming and small-scale production systems. The rapidly changing international environment has pressured farmers in developing countries into adapting and introducing technological improvements in their farming techniques in order to be able to compete in the domestic market with cheap agricultural imports and the large-scale production units of transnational corporations (TNCs). Farmers unable to survive in this environment generally abandon agriculture. Women, usually in the majority among small and subsistence farmers, are not able to take advantage of the opening of new market opportunities for agriculture. As indicated by FAO, women's agricultural activities are limited by a lack of financial capital as well as constrained by inadequate access to productive resources. Women tend to present low levels of mechanization and technological inputs, which translates into low productivity. The intensification of agricultural trade fosters the commercialization of small farms. Integration with the market tends to generate broader changes in rural livelihoods and usually includes diversification of household income, and engaging in off-farm activities or migrating to areas in which waged labour is required. This change in income source affects all types of household capital assets, from the physical and financial to the social and environmental, and interacts with other components of the livelihood system. Household resources tend to be reallocated in favour of cash crop intensification, which may undermine household food production and the role traditionally held by women in being primarily responsible for family food security. An FAO survey of 16 small-farming commercialization (SFC) projects in 14 developing countries of Africa, Asia and Latin America found that, in most cases, increased income entailed losses in the human economy and social reproduction. The cost of buying replacements for household food production, child care, social activities, leisure, education, creative expression and so on, may outstrip the purchasing power of the extra cash. Women had a double economic disadvantage, compared with men. They continued to be fully responsible for \"reproductive\" work such as pregnancies, child care and housekeeping. Second, men controlled the income generated by SFC, even if women had invested an equal or higher amount of labour in its generation. In about half of cases, SFC's impact on women in terms of household decision-making and status in the community were considered neutral or negative. As FAO's research shows, rural households bear significant economic and social costs to attain the benefits of small farm commercialization (SFC) and the expansion of tradable goods. The increased income generated by commercialization requires a parallel increase in household workload. Findings suggest the ambivalence of this impact on rural livelihoods: monetary income brings purchasing power but entails losses in the human economy and social reproduction. As agriculture becomes progressively more market-oriented, rural households can find themselves dependent on monetary income to fulfil family food basic needs. Women in rural areas are traditionally responsible for providing food for the family and may be forced to diversify their livelihoods, seek off-farm employment or emigrate. As a result, rural women find themselves with an increased work burden. They continue to have their traditional primary responsibility for household tasks while integrating into the labour market. Moreover, the switch over, in market-oriented economies, of agricultural land use to cash crops and exports appears to impinge on food growing; the new land use and management strategies do not attempt to sustain household and community livelihood strategies as a safety net and solely reflect a short-term economic profit-oriented focus. Expansion in commercial crop production may have an adverse impact on smallholders and local domestic markets but, at the same time, export-oriented production may help to increase off-farm employment opportunities for women in the short term. Although wages are low, off-farm sources of employment for women in Ghana and Uganda seem to play an important role in yielding the lowest and most rapidly declining rural poverty rates for female heads of households. Women who have traditionally grown their family's food and move out in search of off-farm employment may suffer from a shortage of food supply from the family plots, with implications for the family's nutritional status."

      "article_text": "In order to support women's struggles for equality, new land legislation in Africa has to include explicit and mandatory mechanisms of inclusion In Tanzania, decisions of village councils affect women’s entitlements [FAO/A. Conti] by Zenebeworke Tadesse Ever since the first attempt to record customary land law during the colonial period, a tension has persisted in Africa between the desire to codify this law in a simple and readily identifiable set of rules, and the ever-evolving practice of this law, which is based on hotly contested traditions. Locally derived meanings attached to land and resources are perhaps best understood in terms of a set of rights, and no generalized land codification is likely to reflect the complexity and fluidity of this understanding. What is clear is that customary land laws are not always readily identifiable or consensually determined. What becomes law reflects the relative economic and political power of competing interest groups and individuals. In most African countries, women have few and precarious land rights, if they have them at all. Where land rights specific to women do exist, even this limited entitlement is being eroded by a convergence of external and internal events. Unrelenting economic crises, wars and the HIV/AIDS pandemic, confusingly intertwined with population growth and land scarcity, form the context for attempts to create a market-based economy that will stimulate a market in land. The democratization process has itself contributed to intensified conflicts over land but has also broadened the space for public participation in policy debates. Each of these processes has had a profound impact on gender relations. Replacement or adaptation? Many World Bank studies on African agriculture tend to diagnose that the major constraints on increased productivity arise from the defects of customary tenure. The remedy they prescribe generally involves a move towards individual tenure systems based on statutory law. An alternative approach to tenure reform is that known as the policy of adaptation, which redirects attention to more incremental approaches to changes in indigenous tenure systems. An adaptation paradigm requires a supportive legal and administrative environment for the evolutionary change in indigenous law, which implies clear recognition of the legal applicability and enforceability of indigenous land tenure rules. In Tanzania, the policy of replacement often had unforeseen side-effects, such as dispossessing women of their customary rights to land, and it is far from clear how the adaptation paradigm would address this issue of land for women or what form of dispute settlement mechanism it would propose establishing. Tanzania's National Land Policy (NLP) exemplifies a typical ambivalence concerning women's rights in newly emerging tenure reforms. The NLP states that women will be entitled to acquire land in their own right, not only through purchase but also through allocation. However, inheritance of clan family land will continue to be governed by custom and tradition, and ownership of land between husband and wife shall not be the subject of legislation. In addition to provisions in old and new tenure reform that continue to discriminate against women, a second, related, gender bias emanates from institutions set up to adjudicate land disputes. In Tanzania, the dispute settlement mechanism is known as Mbaraza ya wazee ya ardhi. It is structured so that councils of village elders have primary jurisdiction in all land matters, including settling disputes over individualization of tenure. They determine their own procedures, subject to the obligation to follow the principles of natural justice. They are not bound by any civil or criminal procedure codes or the law of evidence, and they do not hear appeals put forward by lawyers. Since 1986, Ugandan women have made considerable gains on a number of fronts. First among them is the 1995 Constitution, which grants women legal equality and protection in political, economic, social and cultural spheres. Significantly, through the concerted efforts of the Women's Caucus in the Constituent Assembly, it also contains a clause prohibiting \"laws, culture, customs or traditions that violate the dignity, welfare or interest of women.\" In parallel moves, women have been placed in key cabinet positions, including the vice presidency, and have secured 30% of the seats in local government. Furthermore the new constitution supersedes customary law. In other words, customs that undermine the guarantee of equality should in principle be considered unconstitutional. But as there have been no statutory reforms, the constitutional provisions have had little effect on the courts. The controversy sparked by the 1998 Land Act exemplifies the inadequacy of such constitutional provisions alone, illustrating why clauses designed to ensure equality in the spate of new constitutions promulgated throughout Africa during the 1990s have not been effective. Obstacles to women's land rights In post-apartheid South Africa, the central thrust of land policy is the land reform programme, as set out in the 1997 White Paper on South African Land Policy. The White Paper specifies the removal of all legal restrictions on participation by women in land reform, including reform of marriage, inheritance and customary law where they constitute an obstacle to women receiving rights to land, and mechanisms to provide security of tenure to women, including the possibility of registering assets gained through land reform in the name of the household or its individual members. Implementation of those provisions has been constrained in a number of ways. One is that guidelines – to identify beneficiaries and ensure gender equity – do not exist. And a more intractable problem is the persistence of customary practices such as those that prevent women from owning land, those that prevent widows from inheriting land and those that prevent women from speaking in public. As a result, women are perceived as a kind of appendage to male heads of household. In order to be supportive of women's struggles for equality, new land legislation in Africa has to include explicit and mandatory mechanisms of inclusion. For the foreseeable future, the only measures likely to be adopted in some African countries are joint titling of land and, as in Ethiopia, the right of women to own land independent of their marital status. Even these limited measures, to have real meaning, require reforms in inheritance and marriage laws to be legislated for and implemented. A wide array of gender-equitable legislation was passed, in numerous African countries, during the 1990s. However, most of it has remained trapped on paper, either because it is controversial or – more seriously – the costs of implementing it have not been included in public expenditure forecasts. The benefit that women will get from such reforms also depends on the gender awareness of those in charge of administering land, and of those in charge of making agricultural policies and services (such as technical assistance, credit and cooperative societies) more gender-equitable. The key to ushering in sustainable transformations and making gender relations in Africa more equitable is action that strengthens women's bargaining position within the household and ensures women's fall back position in case of family breakdown."
