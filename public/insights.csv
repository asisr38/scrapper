The consensus to come out of all the events is that action towards empowering women in agriculture is long overdue and that there is an urgent need to implement the policy recommendations outlined in the report—creating agricultural policies that consider gender differences, ensuring equality for women under the law, investing in the human capital of women and girls, addressing the multiple constraints of women in agriculture holistically and providing public services and technologies to free up women’s time—in order to improve the lives of rural women and to meet the increasingly complex challenge of food security for a rapidly growing global population.","16/03/2011","2011-03-16","2011","3","https://www.fao.org/gender/insights/insights-detail/The-business-case-for-closing-the-gender-gap-in-agriculture/en","6"
