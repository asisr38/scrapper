      "article_text": "Initially seeking a different path, Ryoujin returned to Jeju and decided to become a haenyeo (or sea woman) like her mother and grandmother before her. ©FAO/David Hogsholt Ryoujin Ko never planned on following in her mother’s or grandmother’s footsteps. She would watch them leave home early to dive off eastern coast of Jeju Island in the Republic of Korea. When the season was right, they would harvest sea urchins, turban shells, abalone and seaweed to support their families. Instead, Ryoujin, like many in her generation, studied hard and dreamt of finding a life in the city. Once she received her degree in athletics, she left. But depression and burnout led her back home, and home led her to the sea. Like her mother and grandmother, she decided to become a haenyeo (or sea woman), the famed, free-diving fisherwomen of Jeju, who venture into the ocean’s depths, using only their breath, skill and memory of the sea’s underwater landscape. Haenyeo are able to dive without oxygen tanks, can hold their breath for one-two minutes, dive to depths of five to 20 meters and may spend up to seven hours a day in the sea. “When I was underwater, all I could think about was surviving. I stopped overthinking,” says Ryoujin. “To me, the ocean is like a second mother. I’ve been healed so much and received so much from it.” A disappearing heritage The tradition of haenyeo stretches back more than a thousand years with records from 1105 already mentioning this trade. The women of Jeju have always been the backbone of island life — fishers, farmers and mothers, often the primary breadwinners in households. In the 1970s, there were 14 000 haenyeo , but in the1980s and 1990s many women left this demanding work for jobs in the tourism and tangerine industries. Today, there are just over 2 700 haenyeo , many are in their seventies and eighties. At 42, Ryoujin is one of the youngest. There are 83 active haenyeo in Ryoujin’s village. Ten plan to retire this year. Below Ryoujin’s generation, there are few — or no — divers. “I worry I’ll be left diving alone. That’s why I welcome anyone who wants to learn. I’ll teach them everything I know,” says Ryoujin. The haenyeo are famed for their free-diving fishing, venturing into the ocean, using only their breath, skill and memory. ©FAO/David Hogsholt A changing ocean Aside from a disappearing trade, the return from the sea is also diminishing. Jeju’s waters are warming due to climate change. As a result, subtropical fish are displacing native species. Invasive predators like the Amur starfish and blue-ringed octopus are appearing. The haenyeo now face new challenges beneath the waves. In her early years, Ryoujin remembers abundant catches. But the harvest has since fallen to less than a quarter of what it once was. “Even though my skills have improved, the ocean gives less. Three years ago, I dried 30 sacks of agar seaweed. This year, only seven.” Despite this, Ryoujin and her community maintain self-regulated seasonal closures, avoid overharvesting and protect vulnerable species like Obunjak (a type of abalone) to help build resilience and preserve the marine ecosystem. The haenyeo see themselves as caretakers as much as foragers. With support from the provincial government, they cull invasive starfish, gather sea urchins before they destroy seaweed beds and release juvenile abalone and sea cucumbers. A new era Despite these trends, there is growing public support and interest in the haenyeo . In 2016 UNESCO recognized Jeju haenyeo culture as an Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity, and in 2023 the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) designated the Jeju Haenyeo Fisheries System as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System (GIAHS) in 2023, affirming the haenyeo's significance as custodians of marine biodiversity, sustainable harvesting practices and an extraordinary communal ethic. Kyung-ho Ko, Director of the Haenyeo Cultural Heritage Division at Jeju Special Self-Governing Province, says this recognition holds great significance. “This elevates the status of Jeju haenyeo , helps pass down this valuable heritage to future generations and contributes to the development of the local community,” he said. “Despite harsh working conditions, environmental changes, declining marine resources, aging and the low influx of new haenyeo , they symbolize the strong identity of women who maintain their livelihoods based on the traditional fishing community.” The Jeju government is working to preserve the haenyeo way of life. According to Director Ko, ₩27.3 billion (USD 20 million) has been invested this year to improve the welfare of haenyeo , support their income, enhance their working environment and preserve and pass down haenyeo culture. The government is now paying for medical costs for diving-related injuries, provides financial allowances for haenyeo in their seventies and eighties and benefits for those over 75 who wish to retire. The local government additionally organizes haenyeo festivals, performances, exhibitions and support haenyeo shamanistic rituals. They have also built schools to train a new generation of haenyeo .

They embody a way of life that respects nature’s limits and treasures interdependence over exploitation. “People call this a ‘3D job’ — dirty, dangerous, demanding,” says Ryoujn. “But for me, it’s the highest form of personal satisfaction.” “Every morning is chaos with my four kids, but heading to the sea, I feel excited — ‘What will the sea give me today?’ That excitement, that healing — it’s a ‘water high’.” There is also a strong sense of community, the haenyeo watch out for each other. The sumbi — the iconic whistle haenyeo make when surfacing — is not just tradition; it’s a lifeline, a signal of survival. “You dive with others within sight, and we always call out to each other with the sumbi sound. It means: 'I’m still here,'” Ryoujn describes. “Women have always played a crucial role in Jeju. To me, haenyeo are women, and women are haenyeo — that’s a source of tremendous pride.” Every 16 October - World Food Day - is a chance to celebrate food heroes around the world. From farmers and fishers to innovators and chefs, food heroes are leading local and global efforts to create more sustainable and resilient agrifood systems. But we can all be food heroes: respect food, eliminate waste, reduce unnecessary consumption. Our actions are our future. Let’s build a better one together. Learn more"

      "article_text": "In Düzce, Türkiye, 32 percent of youth are unemployed. Many opt to move to the city in search of work. Beekeeping offers young people an alternative path and income opportunities in rural areas. ©FAO / Turuhan Alkır Each morning, 22-year-old Züleyha Ceylan drives her small blue truck down the winding village roads, past fields of hazelnut trees, to a patch of colourful beehives in the province of Düzce, some 200 kilometres northwest of Ankara, Türkiye. She slips into her canary-yellow beekeeping suit, pulls on pink gloves and strikes a match. A curl of smoke drifts from her tin smoker, calming the bees before she lifts the lid of the first hive. Inside, the colony hums with life. She studies the frames for honey levels, checks for the queen’s presence and scans for any sign of disease —tasks that require patience, skill and careful observation. Some inspections take just a few minutes; others stretch into half an hour or more—every hive has a life of its own. “Since I was a child, I loved being outdoors with animals and nature,” she says, pausing to listen to the buzzing. “I couldn’t imagine myself stuck in an office job in the city. When I hear the sound of the bees, it feels like therapy. Their buzzing calms me and gives me energy for the day.” When Züleyha began beekeeping last year, some people in her community doubted her choice. “They told me it is a man’s job,” she recalls with a grin. “It was like saying a woman cannot drive a car. Now those same people come to me for advice about their bees.” Although no one in her family had ever been involved in beekeeping, they always believed in Züleyha’s choice. Even while allergic to bees, her father still helped her to buy her first colonies and equipment. “My parents told me, ‘Do what you love,’ and supported me all the way,” she says. “That gave me the courage to move forward.” A way forward Though the province of Düzce is rich in farmland and forests, more than 32 percent of youth between the age of 15 and 24 are unemployed. Many opt to move to the city in search of work, leaving behind old farms and empty villages. Beekeeping offers an alternative path: it requires little land and relatively modest investment while offering flexible hours. Furthermore, demand for honey and related products remains strong. In Düzce, the prized local Yığılca bee, known for its resilience and ability to produce high-quality honey, makes the sector’s outlook even brighter. For Züleyha, who chose to stay in her village, bees have meant both livelihood and independence. “This year I produced about 100 kilos of honey,” she says. “It wasn’t a lot, but it sold out right away through my friends and social media. People trust me because they see how I care for my bees. I even share videos online to explain my products.” Her dreams extend beyond simply producing honey jars. “I want to expand my hives and start producing royal jelly, bee bread, propolis—everything bees can give,” she explains. “One day, I want to build my own company and provide jobs for others.” Düzce's rich forests and unique bee strains make it one of Türkiye’s beekeeping hubs. Training young people in this livelihood contributes to rural development and keeps agricultural heritage alive. ©FAO / Turuhan Alkır Learning, connecting, growing Behind Züleyha’s success is a mix of passion and targeted support. In August 2025, Züleyha joined nine other enthusiastic beekeepers and project participants in a training programme organized by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Provincial Directorate of Agriculture and Forestry. “Before, I didn’t know how to market my products or treat bee diseases properly,” she admits. “Thanks to the training, I learned how to manage colonies, prevent illnesses and sell my honey more effectively. This knowledge gave me confidence.” She left the training with more than just skills. “I met people with experience—it was very inspiring. I am only at the start of my journey, but I hope to become a better producer soon.” A land made for bees Düzce itself is a beekeeping haven. Nearly 60 percent of the province is covered in forest, from fragrant linden to chestnut groves. It is home to around 60 000 hives and some 800 beekeepers. The region even boasts a geographical indication for its rich, dark chestnut honey and hosts a university programme dedicated to apiculture. “A significant part of agricultural production here comes from beekeeping,” explains Ezra Uzun, Provincial Director of Agriculture and Forestry. “Düzce also safeguards the Yığılca queen bee strain in a special isolated zone. Combined with our forests, this gives us unique advantages.” However, the climate crisis is reshaping rainfall patterns and seasonal cycles, affecting bee health and honey yields. Meanwhile, a decreasing rural population threatens the sustainability of farming. Uzun believes the answer lies in collaboration: “Together with FAO, we are working on projects that improve production and branding but also encourage young people to stay in rural areas. Our vision is to pass on agricultural heritage to new generations, combining it with knowledge and technology.” FAO Assistant Representative in Türkiye, Ayşegül Selışık, echoes that vision, “Düzce has tremendous natural advantages for beekeeping. Yet many young people and women face barriers to entering the sector. By providing training, technical support and entrepreneurial skills, we are helping them turn these assets into sustainable livelihoods. The goal is not only to strengthen beekeeping today, but also to ensure that future generations can thrive here.” With FAO support, young beekeepers are learning to market their products and grow sustainable and successful businesses. ©FAO / Turuhan Alkır Sweet future Standing among her hives, Züleyha is optimistic about opportunities in beekeeping. “With FAO’s training and the support of our community, I can see a future here—not just for me, but for the next generation of beekeepers in Düzce.” “Don’t be afraid to try,” she advises other young people. “With the right information and support, you can succeed. And with modern technology, you can sell your products not just locally, but even internationally.” In the winter period, when her bees rest, she paints landscapes, animals and the tiny buzzing friends she misses. “From now on, my life follows the rhythm of the bees. My art helps me to stay connected to them even during these quiet months,” she says with a smile. Every 16 October - World Food Day - is a chance to celebrate food heroes around the world. From farmers and fishers to innovators and chefs, food heroes are leading local and global efforts to create more sustainable and resilient agrifood systems.

Their farms, locally known as chakra, were recognized in 2023 by FAO as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System (GIAHS). ©FAO/ Johanna Alarcón There are still hours to go before dawn, but the roosters of Magdalena Laine are already crowing when the 59-year-old farmer from the Kichwa Indigenous Peoples turns on the sole bulb illuminating the patio of her farm, located outside the Ecuadorian Andean town of Cotacachi. Then, she begins to sieve the maize flour vigorously. “I woke up at 1:30 a.m. because clients come very early,” says Magdalena, referring to the customers frequenting the Sunday La Pachamama nos alimenta (Mother Earth feeds us) , an agroecological market where some 300 Kichwa women come weekly to sell their produce. While Magdalena handles the flour, one of her daughters, Verónica Cumba Laine, 29, is working with her father and a younger sister to prepare the other products Magdalena will be selling at the fair—fresh vegetables, lemons, lupins, quinoa and eggs. They also sell the maize flour and bags of native varieties of maize kernels, that Verónica and Magdalena carefully prepared the evening before. They sell the good kernels at the market but keep the best ones for planting next season. “Right after the harvest, we store the varieties of maize and select the healthiest, cleanest kernels. We preserve them for the next planting season,” says Magdalena. “My mother is a seed guardian. She preserves many native varieties of maize seeds. She is teaching me everything about crops,” explains Verónica. Despite the challenges of farming at altitudes ranging from 2 500 to 3 400 metres above sea level and the increasing impacts of climate change on these fragile ecosystems, Kichwa women and their Indigenous Peoples’ food and knowledge systems have sustained food security and self-sufficiency in this region of Ecuador for centuries. Their plots or farms are locally known as chakra, a biodiverse agricultural system recognized in 2023 by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System (GIAHS). In addition to nutrition, food security and income, chakras provide Kichwa People medicine, fuel and fodder. The secret of the chacra’s success are the Kichwa Indigenous women, like Magdalena, who are seed guardians, preserving and maintaining native seeds, and the unique mountain plateaus, whose different altitudes and microclimates are crucial to the array of crops grown here. © FAO/ Johanna Alarcón By 3:30 a.m., one of the trucks bringing farmers from their chakras to the market reaches Magdalena’s farm. She puts on a traditional pink woollen shawl and rushes towards the truck bed to load her freight. She struggles a bit but finally manages to find space in the cargo area, filled with dozens of products (berries, avocados, honey, potatoes and more) from other Kichwa women, a testament to the extraordinary agrobiodiversity of the chakras . By sunrise, customers already crowd around Magdalena’s stand at the market, held at the headquarters of the Women’s Central Committee of the Union of Peasant and Indigenous Peoples’ Organizations of Cotacachi (UNORCAC). Before noon, she sells almost everything, earning around 50 USD, enough to cover the needs of her family for a week and put aside some money for her daughter's education. The production in chakras, where an average of 25 crops are cultivated, is mainly used for home consumption. “Without farming the chakra, we wouldn’t have much food to eat,” acknowledges Verónica. However, through the Forest and Farm Facility (FFF) mechanism, FAO has supported improving the production of crops in chakras so that the surplus can serve as income generation. The FFF supports local producer groups to provide training to Kichwa women in skills like accounting and marketing to help them engage in direct sales to customers in Cotacachi and other urban centres. Since 2019, some 13 500 rural families throughout Ecuador have benefited from FFF-supported projects. Women and land The secrets to the agrobiodiversity of the Andean chakra are its Kichwa Indigenous women and its topography. Indigenous Women, like Magdalena, are seed guardians, experts on preserving and maintaining the local varieties of native seeds, most notably maize, beans, and squash, while the Andean mountains in this region are formed by unique plateaus—locally known as pisos climáticos — that offer diverse climates and environments. These plateaus, with their different altitude and microclimate variations, are crucial to the large array of crops, vegetables and fruits that Kichwa families produce and enjoy. Climate change-related extreme weather events, like droughts and floods, are now threatening this system, with changing temperatures affecting which crops traditionally grew at which altitude. These changes may also erode the knowledge that Kichwa women pass down to new generations, for instance when a certain crop needs to be planted. “When I was a kid, the climate was normal. Now the climate is changing… The sun is so strong that my clothes seem like I have an iron on my back,” comments Magdalena. She explains the family must now deal with new pests and drier conditions that “kill the plants” and reduce yields. With the financial support and technical assistance of FAO, farmers' organizations like UNORCAC are implementing several initiatives to strengthen the climate resilience of communities. UNORCAC is working with Kichwa communities to diversify food production through the use and exchange of native seeds. “We have seen on our chakras that native seeds resist frosts and droughts,” says María Piñán, leader of the Women’s Central Committee of UNORCAC . With FAO’s financial and technical support, farmers’ organization, UNORCAC, is strengthening the climate resilience of Kichwa communities and helping diversify food production by using native seeds. María Piñán, leader of UNORCAC’s Women’s Committee, has been key in promoting these climate-resilient varieties. ©FAO/ Johanna Alarcón Saving together FAO is also assisting women-led saving groups with trainings in finance. These community-based credit systems offer microloans to its members, enabling rural communities to invest in their plots and improve productivity or cope with emergencies such as a failed harvest. In Cotacachi, some saving groups have increased their credit capacity from 30 USD to over 2 000 USD in five years. “Strengthening the saving groups is part of our strategy to transform the agrifood sector with a vision of inclusive rural development. Without economic resilience, adaptation to climate change will be difficult to achieve,” explains FAO Representative in Ecuador, Gherda Barreto. As she sits by Magdalena in the chakra’s patio, Verónica has lived the challenges of climate change but is confident that the ancestral knowledge passed to her by her mother will help her –and future generations– overcome the difficulties. “Here, women are the ones with the initiative… When I have my own family, I have to sow as my mother did, the same way she taught me. Everything she taught me will stay with me, and I should continue this wisdom.” Every 16 October - World Food Day - is a chance to celebrate food heroes around the world.

      "article_text": "Lush with rainforests and cocoa plantations, the island country of Sao Tome and Principe is rich in biodiversity but faces increasing forest and land degradation due to agricultural expansion, changes in land use and the impacts of climate change. ©FAO/Eduardo Soteras Morning light spills across Praia das Conchas Roça on the island of Sao Tome, as children walk hand in hand to school with their backpacks. Four of them are the children of Camila Varela De Carvalho, a 32-year-old cocoa farmer. Another four are her nephews, all of whom she is raising. After the children head off, Camila grabs a bucket and a harvesting tool, fashioned from a wooden branch and sharpened edge, and treks to her farm. Once among the cocoa trees, she clears branches and picks a ripe cocoa pod. Making a small incision, she splits the pod cleanly in two with a practiced twist —a skill honed from the early age of eight. Inside are white pulp-covered cocoa beans, which she scoops into her bucket. Once dried and fermented, these beans will be sold to become chocolates, providing the income that sustains her family and community. “Cocoa makes a big difference in my life. Because with the money from cocoa I can buy fish and those things for the house we’re without,” Camila explains. In addition to tending her farm, she works three other jobs while her husband works two. One of these, and her favourite one, is working at the Organic Cocoa Production and Export Cooperative (CECAB), where she is a cocoa inspector. She handles everything from weighing and selecting to stirring the cocoa beans for drying. The Restoration Initiative (TRI) works with cocoa cooperatives and supports cocoa farmers—especially women producers like Camila —with improved techniques and organic and fair-trade certifications. ©FAO/Eduardo Soteras Sao Tome and Principe, an island country of the coast of West Africa, relies heavily on cocoa production to support local livelihoods. Lush with rainforests and cocoa plantations, the island is rich in biodiversity but faces increasing forest and land degradation due to agricultural expansion, changes in land use and the impacts of climate change. Working with cocoa cooperatives in the country, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the national government, launched a project to restore degraded forest ecosystems and enhance sustainable cocoa production as part of The Restoration Initiative (TRI). Funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and in collaboration with International Union for Conservation of Nature and the United Nations Environment Programme, TRI supports nine countries in their journey to restore ecosystems and degraded landscapes. In Sao Tome and Principe, TRI supports cocoa farmers—especially women producers—with improved agroforestry techniques and organic and fair-trade certifications. FAO partnered with CECAB, an organic cocoa cooperative, of which Camila is now a part. “Before CECAB, we harvested cocoa, and tractors came to buy it…When the tractor was full, they almost didn't buy any cocoa. But now with CECAB, whenever you arrive, you can sell your cocoa,” says Camila. Established in 2005, CECAB is now the island’s largest cooperative, uniting 37 producer groups and benefiting more than 2 000 families. The money Camila earns from selling her highest-yielding crop, cocoa, now allows her to cover her family's living expenses and her children's education, with enough left to last until the end of the year. Restoring island land and trees Since 2019, “more than 8 000 hectares of agroforestry areas have been restored and we had the collaboration of 3 500 farmers in these activities,” says Faustino Oliveira, the FAO national project coordinator. The goal is to reach 36 000 hectares, or one third of the country by 2030. The project established nurseries to grow endemic fruit and other tree species with now over 240 980 seedlings mainly produced and planted in agroforestry plots on both the Sao Tome and Principe islands. In 2024, Sao Tome and Príncipe’s cocoa agroforestry was recognized by FAO as a Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System (GIAHS). In these traditional gardens, farmers grow a unique and significant variety of cocoa, the Amelonado variety, alongside other fruit trees, creating forest landscapes. This way of farming, passed down for generations, has helped families like Camila’s keep their land fertile, protect water sources and face climate challenges with resilience. The GIAHS recognition also opens the door to organic and fair-trade certifications, stronger value chains and greater visibility for cocoa farmers. Working with CECAB, the island’s largest cocoa cooperative, Camila’s income from cocoa now allows her to cover her family's living expenses and her children's education. ©FAO/Eduardo Soteras A sweet dream Going forward, Camila dreams of making her own chocolates and blending her own cocoa at CECAB’s own chocolate factory that they established to ensure that farmers benefit from every step of the cocoa value chain. “The transformation of their product into chocolate gives us feel enormous satisfaction because it is the first time that the people of Sao Tome have their own factory,” says Antonia dos Lantos Neto, manager of CECAB’s chocolate factory. Camilla has already participated in entrepreneurship training and sessions at CECAB through the project, learning to work with tablets, weigh cocoa and dispatch beans. It doesn’t faze her that cocoa production in Sao Tome is a male-dominated field. As she works towards making her dream a reality, her message to her fellow women farmers is: “Being a woman farmer means being a strong fighter. That we, women farmers, always continue to work to ensure there is never a shortage of products on the market. Not even at CECAB,” she concludes.

      "article_text": "Cambodia’s wet season is becoming unpredictable, but now improved flood-resistant seeds are helping Seuy Phok and other rice farmers have more reliable harvests. ©FAO/Sopheak Em After her mother passed, Seuy Phok tended her fields with little help while raising her child alone. “Mixing the fertilizer, ploughing, and sowing—I do it all by myself,” she says. For over four decades, Seuy harvested rice on land passed down from her grandmother and late father, using their same methods to work the land in the Tean Kam commune of northwestern Cambodia. In June, the country’s wet season, rains sweep across rice fields and the broader Cambodian landscape, soaking rice paddies and the ground that generations of farmers have cultivated for their daily meal and family income. Over the years, the rains have grown unpredictable –sometimes arriving too late, sometimes too strong – leaving farmers in the lurch about when to plant and how to harvest. Four years ago, heavy rainfall submerged and flattened Seuy’s rice fields, damaging her crops. What little remained became difficult to harvest, necessitating machines to do the work that is usually manual. Then Seuy learned about and joined the “Promoting Climate-Resilient Livelihoods in Rice-based Communities in the Tonle Sap Region” (PCRL) project, led by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and funded by the Global Environment Facility. The project provided high-quality rice seeds suited to a new climate reality and on-the-ground training in sustainable practices to help farmers better adapt to a changing climate. After receiving certified seeds and training on seed production, Seuy’s yields started doubling, and she could sell seeds in addition to rice. “I sold one barrel and ten bags of rice the first year,” Seuy recalls. “The second harvest was much better: two barrels and five bags.” FAO’s PCRL project implemented farmer field schools and provided high-quality rice seeds to help farmers better adapt to a changing climate. Left/top: ©FAO/Bormey Chy. Right/bottom: ©FAO/Sopheak Em The certified seeds are not just more resilient to climate stress. They bloom into renowned fragrant jasmine rice that garners greater demand in export markets. “It’s good, not discolored and the traders don’t think twice,” says Champey Ream, a rice farmer in the Ang Trapeang Thmor Protected Landscape of northwestern Cambodia. “We can secure higher prices,” she says. With support from PCRL, Champey adopted new techniques that reduced her use of seeds, fertilizers and pesticides. “We use fewer seeds and apply fertilizers according to the techniques we learned,” she explains. “Our rice used to suffer from diseases, but now it’s healthy, with robust growth and high purity.” From just 40 kilograms of seeds, Champey harvested two tons of rice, earning nearly 1.5 million Riels, or USD 375. “We’ve doubled our yield,” she says. “And we spend less on seeds and fertilizers while improving our health and income.” The better seeds blossomed into new opportunities for Seuy: fences for fields, walls for a new house and extra savings to reinvest on her farm. Beyond the land, the extra income supports her child’s education. “The money I earn goes to school fees,” she says. “It helps children learn without falling into debt.” Champey has worked hard to ensure that her children and grandchildren gain an education for a sustainable future. Her daughter excelled and earned a scholarship to pursue a doctorate in environmental research, and Champey’s rice farming is now supporting her grandchildren’s schooling. “Knowledge is extremely important to help them and to help us,” says Champey. A lifelong advocate for women’s empowerment, Champey has helped organize training sessions for women in her village and dreams of developing ecotourism in the community protected area and marketing its local products. “I want other women to be strong, to understand the value of knowledge,” says Champey. “Not to think that wealth is everything—without knowledge, it’s not enough. Applying new techniques that she learned in trainings, Champey Ream has reduced her use of seeds, fertilizers and pesticides, but still doubled her yield. She hopes to help other women farmers do the same. ©FAO/Bormey Chy PCRL’s farmer field schools are helping to spread knowledge of sustainable farming and providing hands-on experience in 17 community protected areas and 45 communes in the Tonle Sap region. Farmers learn about climate-resilient rice and how to apply fertilizer efficiently based on the soil type. The project promotes drought- and flood-tolerant rice varieties, water-efficient land preparation and crop diversification. Demonstration plots bring lessons to life, and farmers learn to document progress and improvements in yield each season. When climate finance unlocks access to inputs and knowledge, farmers are able to weather the uncertainties of a changing climate. For Seuy and Champey, farming is more than a livelihood—it’s a path to dignity, independence and a better future for their families. “I want peace for families, peace for society,” Champey says. “As a woman, I want to understand the world—and help others do the same.” In the rice fields of Cambodia, that vision is taking root and growing fast.

      "article_text": "FAO/Bunafsha Azimova In the heart of Tajikistan, a woman has defied the odds, shattered social norms and transformed the agricultural landscape of communities. Her story is marked by resilience, determination and a deep love of the land, and it serves as a powerful reminder that leadership and success are not tied to being a woman or a man. From humble beginnings, Gulbahor Rajabova has become a pioneer in the agricultural sector, empowering her community and inspiring future generations. A story of resilience and innovation Gulbahor Rajabova, 45, grew up on her family’s farm in the Spitamen district of the Sughd region. From a young age, Gulbahor learned the value of hard work, helping her parents grow cotton and raise silkworms. However, the collapse of the Soviet Union brought immense challenges to family farms. They faced debts, outdated equipment and a lack of irrigation – issues that led many other farmers to abandon their farms. But Gulbahor was determined not to let her family’s land go to waste. “I proposed to take charge of the farm,” she recalls. “No one else would be able to recover the money we had already invested. So, I decided to step up. In 2006, the land yielded only 6 centners of cotton (about 600 kg) per hectare. It was a meagre result.” With courage and determination, Gulbahor took on the leadership of the Nurobod dekhkan farm, and over the next few years, she improved the situation. As cotton yields increased to 25 centners per hectare, the farm began to pay off its debts. But Gulbahor didn’t stop there. In 2014, she led the transition from cotton farming to seed production, founding the Nurobod Seed Producing Farm. This shift allowed the farm to produce wheat seeds and achieve higher yields, from 33 centners up to 61 centners per hectare. Despite the challenges of being a woman in a male-dominated sector, Gulbahor’s perseverance paid off. She has built a strong, supportive team and a successful farm. “Now, we have the technology and knowledge to thrive,” she says. © FAO/Bunafsha Azimova Under her leadership, Nurobod Seed Producing Farm has invested in wells for a reliable water supply and is now debt free, with shareholders enjoying a stable, prosperous future. The Strengthening Resilience of the Agriculture Sector project – funded by the World Bank and implemented by the state institution Agriculture Entrepreneurship Development, with technical support from FAO – gave the Nurobod Seed Producing Farm essential resources such as mineral fertilizers and elite seeds, which greatly improved the quality and yields of the crops. “These resources have not only enhanced the quality of our products but have also increased our productivity,” says Gulbahor. The project also provided training, which played a crucial role in enhancing the skills and knowledge of Gulbahor’s team. “We gained new knowledge and skills that we hadn’t been aware of before,” she says. “This collaboration has not only increased the farm’s productivity but has also empowered the team to make environmentally responsible decisions that benefit both the land and the community. The project has helped us adapt to modern farming methods and ensured that our growth is both sustainable and responsible.” One of the key takeaways for Gulbahor and her team was the proper disposal of empty fertilizer bags and containers. “In the past, we didn’t know that we shouldn’t leave empty fertilizer bags and containers on the land or in storage,” she says. “Now, we know it’s not advisable to reuse them, and we make sure to deliver them to an authorized organization to prevent any harmful impact on human health and the environment.” Gulbahor’s journey is one not just of agricultural success, but also of empowerment. As a pioneer in the industry, she aims to inspire other women to take leadership roles in farming. © FAO/Bunafsha Azimova A shared legacy of empowerment and progress Gulbahor’s experience illustrates her unwavering determination to succeed and her commitment to improving the lives of those around her. Through her leadership, she has not only transformed her farm but also empowered other women to follow her example. She is a mentor, advocate for education, and champion of sustainable agriculture. Gulbahor’s story demonstrates that with passion, perseverance and a belief in one’s own abilities, it is possible to overcome any obstacle and create lasting change."

      "article_text": "The potato is now a symbol of national transformation. Lesotho chose the potato as its priority product and joined FAO’s One Country One Priority Product (OCOP) initiative in 2022. ©FAO/ Carl Houston McMillan Amidst craggy peaks and rolling highland plateaus characteristic of the Lesotho’s terrain, there is a remote town in the mountains of Maseru District where Mabitsoane Diholo goes every day to work on her farm. The humble potato is her main crop, but humble no longer describes its place in her life. “This potato has built my house. It has educated my children,” says Mabitsoane, the 53-year-old farmer and mother of seven. “I used to grow potatoes just to eat at home and feed my children. Now, it is my livelihood.” Once grown mainly for family consumption, the potato is now a symbol of national transformation. Choosing this tuber as its priority product, Lesotho joined the One Country One Priority Product (OCOP) initiative of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in 2022. Mabitsoane is one of 750 farmers who FAO supported through this initiative. A lead farmer and active member of the Potato Lesotho Association, she also runs a roadside eatery and mentors others in her community. Whereas she used to sell whatever potatoes she had leftover by the road, with her increased volume thanks in part to seeds and fertilizers provided by FAO, she now sells to Maluti Fresh Produce Market in Maseru. A primary activity of the OCOP project is to connect farmers to local markets to stabilize and increase their income from these priority crops. Maluti Fresh Produce Market manager, Thabo Khalema says, “This market is pivotal in Lesotho’s horticulture industry.” He continues, “It gives local farmers a path to commercial farming, with fair pricing, transparency and real income. They’re no longer just producers — they’re entrepreneurs.” “I get paid twice a week. This has changed our lives,” Mabitsoane comments. “Before, we sold by the roadside and got cheated. Now, people come back again and again because they know my potatoes are good.” “In Lesotho, the potato was already widely grown,” explains Nthimo Mokitinyane, FAO’s OCOP Focal Point in Lesotho. “But what was missing was coordination. Now, with better seeds, improved practices and market access, farmers are moving from subsistence to commercial farming.” He points to productivity increases of up to 20 percent in pilot areas. With the training they received through the OCOP initiative, he states, “We’re seeing farmers make decisions based on data — about what to plant, when and how to market it. It’s no longer guesswork — it’s business.” His Majesty King Letsie III of Lesotho, an FAO Special Goodwill Ambassador for Nutrition, states that the commercial potential of the potato can empower rural women and provide opportunities for young people. © FAO/ Carl Houston McMillan Women at the forefront More than 60 percent of OCOP-supported farmers are women. “They are the first to show up, to try new practices and to share knowledge,” Mokitinyane says. “I’m not working for myself only,” Mabitsoane says. “I’m working to uplift my fellow women. This project is giving us power to take care of our families.” This sense of empowerment resonates with Maleuta Mahao, a 27-year-old who started farming just two years ago. “I used to think farming was just digging,” she says. “Now I know it’s business — about profit, planning and feeding the nation.” Maleuta began with just 25 kilograms of seed and recently harvested over 300 kilograms of potatoes. She says that the OCOP project helped her believe in herself. “I want to be a big farmer and inspire others. People in the village ask me, ‘How did you do it?’ I tell them: ‘start small, work hard and keep going’.” “Women have been at the forefront of agricultural production for decades,” explains His Majesty King Letsie III of Lesotho, an FAO Special Goodwill Ambassador for Nutrition. “If we unlock the commercial potential of the potato, it can empower rural women and attract young people struggling to find jobs.” Transforming farming into business Lesotho’s high-altitude climate offers ideal conditions for potato farming, and the crop is central to the country’s strategy for food security and economic resilience. But turning potential into reality requires investment, markets and innovation. “Farmers need to know their produce will sell and generate income to reinvest in farming,” King Letsie III. Kutloelo Kothoelo Molapo, Project Coordinator of the Potato Lesotho Association, says OCOP has redefined how farmers operate. “Our members used to be subsistence growers,” she explains. “Now they’re talking about contracts, quality standards and profit margins. The mindset has changed.” The Association now works closely with farmers to meet market demands — from consistent supply to post-harvest handling. “Buyers want clean, sorted potatoes with no rot. Our farmers are delivering that,” Molapo says. This growing commercial awareness is critical. According to Minister of Agriculture, Food Security and Nutrition, Thabo Mofosi, “OCOP is a game-changer. We used to rely heavily on imports… Now, with this initiative, we’re building local capacity to produce more.” Mofosi says the goal is not just food security but economic transformation. “We are supporting the entire value chain — production, processing, transport and markets. That means jobs, income and dignity.” Turning the potato’s commercial potential into reality requires investment, markets and innovation— focus areas of FAO’s OCOP initiative. ©FAO/ Carl Houston McMillan Maleuta is already dreaming big. “I want to grow for the whole country — not just for my village,” she says. “I want to build something lasting.” For the more experienced Mabitsoane, farming has also become a means to invest in education. Her daughter is now at university, inspired by her mother’s journey. “She wants to be like me,” Mabitsoane says proudly. “A businesswoman.” This transformation — from subsistence to entrepreneurship — is what OCOP enables. “I have high hopes for the children of farming communities,” says King Letsie III. “My biggest hope is that they grow as healthy citizens, nourished by nutritious foods produced in rural areas, enabling them to be productive adults.” FAO’s OCOP initiative works by helping countries focus on one strategic crop and strengthen its full value chain — from seeds to sales. For Lesotho, the potato is no longer just a staple. It’s a catalyst — for women’s empowerment, youth employment and a more resilient rural future. Every 16 October - World Food Day - is a chance to celebrate food heroes around the world. From farmers and fishers to innovators and chefs, food heroes are leading local and global efforts to create more sustainable and resilient agrifood systems. But we can all be food heroes: respect food, eliminate waste, reduce unnecessary consumption. Our actions are our future. Let’s build a better one together. Learn more"

      "article_text": "Women spend up to five hours a day collecting woodfuel and cooking. ©FAO/Luis Tato Five hours. That's how long women in energy-poor households spend each day on cooking-related tasks—time not spent in school, earning income, or caring for themselves. Multiply that by 2.1 billion people still cooking with traditional fuels, this represents a significant barrier to progress that gets far less attention than it deserves. It isn’t just a matter of convenience. Household air pollution from traditional cooking methods causes 3.7 million premature deaths each year. Cooking with unsustainable, polluting fuels costs the world trillions in damage to the environment and local economies, but it’s women who pay the heftiest price. Women often spend around two hours a day collecting fuel and another three hours tending to the fire and cooking. This unpaid, invisible labour limits girls’ education and exposes them to gender-based violence. In some communities, women are responsible for up to 91 percent of the time and effort spent collecting fuel and water for their household. On average, their workday lasts 11 to 14 hours, compared to about 10 hours for men. The situation is critical in sub-Saharan Africa, where four in five people still cook with traditional woodfuel. Clean cooking systems—efficient stoves powered by biogas or other clean-burning energy sources—offer a practical shift in how food is prepared, especially in regions where wood and charcoal remain the norm. These technologies reduce health risks from indoor air pollution, ease pressure on natural resources, and open up time and income opportunities for households. Yet despite their clear benefits, clean cooking solutions receive limited attention and support, leaving billions without access to something as fundamental as a safe way to cook. FAO has documented how clean cooking systems like biogas cookstoves are making women’s lives easier, reducing the impact on forests and minimizing polluting emissions that harm both people and the planet. Organic waste, such as animal manure or crop residues, can be fermented in a biodigester, producing biogas for cooking and leaving behind nutrient-rich fertilizer. It’s a clean, cost-effective, and climate-friendly solution. In some countries, innovations such as converting sustainably collected crop and livestock waste into pellets and biogas have the potential to significantly expand access to clean cooking. In Rwanda, for instance, they could increase access to clean cooking fuels by up to 33 percent , while in Zambia they could meet up to the 12 percent of the country’s clean cooking fuel target. Some studies show that switching to clean cooking solutions can save a person nearly 29 days each year in time spent collecting fuel and cooking. Household air pollution from traditional cooking methods causes 3.7 million premature deaths each year. ©FAO/Giulio Napolitano FAO is working to expand access to clean cooking solutions for all, choosing fuels and technologies that fit the local needs—whether in rural areas, cities, or humanitarian settings. This includes supporting the installation of biogas systems, providing cleaner and more efficient cookstoves, piloting alternative sustainable fuels, and building local capacity for stove production and maintenance. At the policy level, FAO is promoting key enabling practices to promote this access. A 2025 FAO study on bioethanol for clean cooking in Africa highlights some of these, including eliminating VAT and import duties on clean fuels and stoves, adopting international fuel standards, and embedding clean cooking into national food security, health and climate strategies. Results-based financing schemes and microloans have also boosted women entrepreneurs’ role in the clean cooking value chain. Clean cooking is not just an energy or climate issue: it’s interlinked with equality, health, and opportunity. Clean cooking technologies help families prepare a wider range of meals by cutting down on cooking time, reducing fuel limitations, and minimizing harmful smoke exposure. They support better food safety and free up household budgets, enabling families to buy a greater variety of nutritious ingredients. The result is healthier, more balanced diets. Momentum is slowly building, but clean cooking still doesn’t get the spotlight it deserves, despite being profoundly transformative. Rural women from India shared how a humble biogas stove, running on even humbler cow manure, had allowed them to breathe easier, send their daughters to school, start kitchen gardens. Biogas cooking systems freed their time from the chore of collecting firewood, their yards from unhygienic waste, and their homes from smoke, all the while providing free fuel and fertilizer. They became climate advocates, supporting others to shift to clean energy. Clean cooking is more than a household improvement—it’s a stepping stone toward safer, more stable livelihoods. To make real progress, clean cooking must be included in broader conversations—about health, food security, energy access, and long-term investment in communities. The opportunity is clear. What’s needed now is the commitment to act. Because what lights the stove, fires the change.

      "article_text": "In Afghanistan, where women's livelihood options are limited, the women of Jabal Saraj have turned producing pickles and jams into a source of income. ©FAO/Hashim Azizi Jars brimming with assorted produce sit neatly stacked on the table—freshly made pickles, jams and deep-red tomato paste. Nearby, a group of women carefully dice bright orange carrots and grind garlic cloves, while others peel apples—each adding to the growing piles of fresh ingredients, ready to be processed and packaged into containers. In this district of Jabal Saraj, in the northeastern Parwan province of Afghanistan, these women turned producing jams and pickles into their way of making a living. Hasina and 19 other women gather here regularly to peel, dice and package food for sale, becoming providers for their families. In Afghanistan, where women's livelihood options are limited, agriculture remains a critical pathway for them. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) leverages its expertise to support women to tap into these agricultural opportunities. “Prior to starting this, we were housewives. We faced financial difficulties and emotional stress. Now this project showed us that us women can stand on our own feet,” Hasina explains. As part of the Household Food and Livelihood Security (HFLS) project, funded by the Government of Luxembourg, FAO helped to set up the centre where Hasina and other women prepare and package the products. In addition to the centre, the project also provided equipment and training so that the women could learn to properly process and market a variety of produce. When they began selling these products in local markets, the women started earning their own income. This allowed them to afford essentials such as food, clothes and school fees for their children. Hasina uses the money to cover her five children's school expenses, buy milk and baby products and pay for transportation costs. The food processing centre initiative, part of the Household Food and Livelihood Security project, has provided women with agricultural inputs and skills to operate small-scale food processing business as a livelihood option. ©FAO/Hashim Azizi Mobilising skills and women’s potential Hasina and the other women also received guidance and support from women social mobilisers who engage closely with them. Social mobilisers are young women and men, recruited and trained by the HLFS project, who recently finished studying agriculture and are putting what they learned into practice. They pass on this learning in the areas of nutrition education, sanitation, childcare and access to public services to other members of the community. Fazila Sadat, a social mobiliser who works with Hasina’s group, guides them through regular practical sessions: from how to safely prepare each product to how to improve packaging and hygiene. Early on, Fazila met with the group once or twice a week to conduct hands-on training. As the women gained skills and confidence, the sessions shifted to weekly check-ins to discuss progress, markets, and production plans to ensure learning was put into practice. In addition, to help the women expand beyond local markets, the project created opportunities to showcase their products in agricultural fairs and exhibitions. One such event took place in Kabul, where women from the centre connected with buyers and learned about market demand. They also improved their marketing by designing and printing product labels to attract more consumers. The support of the project has given Hasina and others the opportunity to support their own families. It has also fostered community engagement—a space where the women gather not only to address economic challenges but also offer emotional support. Social mobilisers provide guidance and support to women in the centre and offer necessary training and skills. ©FAO/Hashim Azizi Growing impact Between January and June 2025, women in the four target districts involved in food processing initiatives through the HFLS project produced over 154 000 kilograms of goods for sale—ranging from jams and chutneys to sauces and pickles. These sales generated approximately AFN 6 930 000 (USD 99 000), income they would not have otherwise earned, and helped to reduce dependence on imported products from other countries. FAO’s broader Food, Nutrition and Livelihood Security programme in Afghanistan focuses on supporting the poorest 20 percent of households in each targeted district. The Programme identifies the most viable and profitable livelihood strategies based on local conditions and market potential. Participants then receive tailored assistance such as farming inputs, food processing kits and business training bolstering productivity and livelihoods. Since April 2010, the Programme has reached more than 385 000 people across 16 districts in eight provinces, supporting some 55 000 families—around one in six of which are headed by women.

      "article_text": "25/06/2025 Jharkhand, the ‘land of the forests’ is also a land of contrasts. In this part of eastern India, the soil is rich with minerals, ripe for farming, but often blighted by droughts and erratic monsoons.

For the women of these producer groups, this means their children can go to school and their livelihoods are more secure. Their success demonstrates that Jharkhand’s farmers have transformative power when given access to the right resources. Asha Devi – now the Chair of Kanke’s producer group – is just one of these women. “I got married young and I stayed at home. We used old farming techniques and grew small amounts for our families – we didn’t take anything to the market to sell,” she recalls. But when she joined the Kanke producer group, formed under the JOHAR programme, she saw an opportunity to pool her resources and sell produce together with other farmers, overcoming the challenges of fragmented landholdings and limited mechanization. Additionally, the Kanke producer group received investment and support from JOHAR to develop high-value agriculture, providing them access to better tools and modern techniques. Smallholders can rent affordable farm equipment and machinery from JOHAR’s app-based Custom Hiring Centres – with ‘one-stop-shop’ Agri-marts providing easy access to quality seeds, fertilizer and tools – helping to improve productivity. A digital mobile app also developed by the programme helps farmers with crop planning, monitoring and pest-disease advisories, while a dedicated call centre provides expert support, grievance redressal and timely information on markets and financial support. As business thrived, Asha stepped up to lead her producer group. Together with fellow women leaders from the Bero and Mandar districts they identified the need for better market access and business development. With support from the Government of Jharkhand, investment from the World Bank and technical expertise from FAO, they founded the Sarhul Ajeevika Farmer Producer Company Limited, a cooperative of producer groups working together to capitalize on production timing and market access. Under the direction of Asha and these women leaders, Sarhul has flourished. The company now incorporates over 14 000 women, who each have a financial stake in the company. “Today, we understand everything about our businesses, from profit margins to local market demands. We’ve learned how to negotiate together for better prices, and we know that we don’t have to settle for less,” Asha exclaims. These skills have enabled Asha and other women farmers to take charge of their own finances. “Our children now say their mothers are entrepreneurs, and that’s our biggest reward,” she says. Sarhul CEO, Sanjeev Kumar, testifies to its growth and potential. “We are supporting women-led businesses and monitoring the market,” he explains. “In 2019, we did business worth just ₹ 200 000 (USD 2 300). By 2023, we had grown to ₹ 25 million (USD 290 000), and today, we’re on track for ₹ 35 million (USD 405 000) – a growth rate of over 180 percent!” he says. K. Srinivasan, Secretary of the Rural Development Department for the Government of Jharkhand, holds this success up as a tribute to the integrated, value chain approach of JOHAR. “JOHAR has introduced village women to modern agriculture technologies and processing techniques. Many of these women are tribal, and some were landless. They are now successfully bringing their produce to market, which is boosting their household incomes. We have seen significant results here, throughout the value chain,” he remarks. At the bustling Agri-mart by a teeming junction in Patratu, Ramgarh, manager Deepak Kumar showcases his products. “I supply agricultural goods across the blocks,” he says. “Farmers come here for top-quality products at affordable prices, including earthworm manure and innovative pest control solutions like pheromone traps, sticky traps and lemongrass sprays.” “When we introduced high-value agriculture, we saw the need for better inputs,” said Deepak Upadhyay, Acting JOHAR Project Director of the JSLPS. “We set up local Agri-marts, then launched seedling nurseries to boost productivity, backed by improved infrastructure for timely harvests.” More than 550 soilless seedling centres and poly-house nurseries – run by women entrepreneurs – now supply strong seedlings to both group members and nearby farmers, building thriving rural businesses. At the same time, irrigation was introduced for the first time – many using solar pumps. Water User Groups were formed, benefiting over 60 000 households. “Solar irrigation is a game changer,” Upadhyay added. “To ensure access, we developed tricycle-mounted pumps, allowing women farmers to bring water to their fields with ease.” Crucially, the programme has also provided targeted support to poultry and goat producers, through its trained cadre of over 1 500 village-based female Community Service Providers – “Pashu Sakhis”, who provide technical, business and market advice to farmers. Trained in partnership with the Agriculture Sector Skills Council of India, Pashu Sakhis offer inputs, training, advice for production and marketing, insurance and monitoring, with expertise in livestock, vegetable production, fisheries, and non-timber forest products. “Cadres from within the farming communities provide crucial knowledge and support, boosting productivity and improving value chains,” said Secretary K. Srinivasan. Near Asha’s home in Kanke lives Dharmi Devi in the tribal village of Malsiring, a community of subsistence farmers, with many homes built from mud and thatch. Forced to abandon her education due to financial hardship, today Dharmi is a successful backyard poultry producer who has risen to the position of co-Director of Sarhul, alongside Asha. Dharmi has also been elected by the village to become the head of the Village Council. “It’s like a dream, but it’s my reality,” Dharmi shares. Through Sarhul, Dharmi and her local producer group received 30 hens – a modest start which Malsiring’s women farmers turned into a thriving business. “We sold the first batch and earned a profit of ₹ 10 000 (USD 110), which inspired me to invest, buy 100 more hens and double my profit,” she explains. “Sarhul handles the sales and arranges transport to market.” In Jharkhand, over 65 000 households have benefited from livestock support and value-chain investment, including in commercial poultry farming. Producers like Dharmi have seen incomes increase 84-fold from around ₹ 800 (USD 10) to ₹ 72,000 (USD 840). Dharmi’s chicks started life at the Divyansh Agro Poultry Hatchery, near Ranchi. Here at the hatchery, rows of incubators – precisely regulated for temperature and humidity to create ideal hatching conditions – transform eggs into healthy chicks. Chirps echo through the hatchery as the chicks receive nutrition and vaccinations, setting them up for a robust start in life. This facility is a crucial link in the chain of support to backyard poultry producers like Dharmi. She and other smallholders from nearby villages collect boxes of chicks, to raise them in backyards until they’re ready for market. “Our mission has always been to support the villagers,” explains Vikash Kumar Choudhary CEO, Divyansh Agro Poultry Hatchery. \"When we started in 2021, we were delivering 10 000 chicks weekly, but as we partnered with JOHAR, demand grew, and we increased our capacity to 100 000 per week – a ten-fold increase in a couple of years.” The hatchery specializes in producing healthy and high-quality backyard poultry breeds like Sonali and Croiler, which are in demand by rural women’s producer groups, like Dharmi’s. \"By improving the breeding system, they can produce more eggs and meat in less time,\" Vikash says. Vikash faced significant challenges in securing investment for his business. \"When we started, no bank would talk to us,\" he recalls. \"But after connecting with JOHAR and scaling up production, orders grew, and banks took notice.\" Driven by a commitment to support rural farmers, Vikash innovated a solar-powered hatchery machine capable of hatching 500 eggs at once. \"I realized if I faced challenges, rural women farmers would face even bigger barriers. This machine allows farmers to hatch chicks at home and become entrepreneurs.\" Vikash attributes his success to the programme’s support: \"Training on hatchery management and chick quality, along with connections to backyard growers, helped us expand from a small business to a major supplier, serving Jharkhand and beyond.\" JOHAR has not only increased the availability of poultry to backyard growers – it has also created an organized value chain. Women can buy quality chicks and sell their poultry at a fair price, with profits distributed among them. With mortality rates for poultry plummeting due to improved knowledge, inputs and vaccination, farmers are achieving remarkable egg production levels. Each household now produces up to 90 000 eggs annually, with 80 000 eggs collected daily from 300 households and sold through Sarhul, ensuring fair prices and market access. These poultry initiatives are now producing three million eggs annually – around five percent of Jharkhand’s entire egg supply – reducing the state’s dependence on imports. Farmers like Dharmi are benefiting, not only from increased incomes, but also from improved nutrition and food security. Up in the forested hills of Bero to the east of Ranchi, a lemongrass distillation facility radiates productivity. A man tends a roaring furnace, feeding the flames to extract essential oil. Nearby, piles of fragrant dry lemongrass await processing, while women carry bundles of freshly cut grass from the surrounding fields. The air is filled with the earthy, citrus scent as the facility transforms the raw material into a valuable product. Sarhul brought more than 250 tribal women together to form this lemongrass producer group, growing the crop across 70 acres of previously uncultivable land. With investment through JOHAR, a distillation facility was established, producing 350 litres of high-quality oil in 2023, now sold across the state. Across Jharkhand, JOHAR has set up five such facilities, generating substantial profits for farmers. Mithila Devi, producer group member, proudly presents the facility. “Earlier, we didn’t know how to grow and sell lemongrass, but after joining JOHAR, we realized this would bring us a good profit – even in the dry season,” she explains. “I have lived in poverty since childhood, but I have been enabled to work for this, and to help other women do well too.” In Jharkhand, where forests play a vital role in rural livelihoods – particularly for marginalized tribal groups – harvesting aromatic plants and non-timber forest products sustainably and profitably has helped to diversify livelihoods and build resilience. In a nearby tribal village in Raidih, women skilfully cultivate lac – a natural resin secreted by insects on host trees – a practice which has been passed down through generations. Under the forest canopy they inspect the resin-covered branches. Some scrape away pests or apply new lac brood to ensure healthy growth, while others collect the hardened resin. Lac, prized for its use in cosmetics and pharmaceuticals, provides these remote villages with a sustainable source of income. Its climate-resilient nature helps to ensure income security for farmers, particularly during droughts, when staple crops like paddy may fail. Traditionally, communities here depended on forests during lean agricultural months but lacked modern techniques and facilities to fully benefit. Throughout Jharkhand, these investments have transformed forest resources, like lac and lemongrass, into market-ready products by building facilities, supporting producer groups, and connecting communities to buyers. In addition to boosting productivity and promoting quality produce from hard-to-reach areas, JOHAR has ensured that producer groups access markets through informed market analysis and production planning. Farmers can now produce the right products, at the right time, for the right market. The journeys of Asha, Dharmi and Mithila and thousands of other women are testament to the transformative power of investing in women’s skills development, producer groups and local value chains. With leadership from JSLPS, and partnership from FAO and the World Bank, thousands of Jharkhand’s women have not only improved their livelihoods but also created a model of agrifood system transformation that will continue to benefit their communities for generations to come. This is part of a series of stories to mark the 60th anniversary of the FAO Investment Centre, highlighting decades of partnerships, initiatives and investments that have shaped agrifood systems. Explore how the FAO Investment Centre continues to drive agricultural investment and finance solutions, transforming lives globally."

The farmer field schools are a key component of the Building a Resilient Churia Region in Nepal project, funded by the Green Climate Fund (GCF) and implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) together with the Government of Nepal. The project empowers farmers to lead solutions for the increasing climate-related challenges for agriculture. Farmer field schools improve its members’ livelihood prospects and confidence. Khilamaya is now a vocal and active participant in the school, sharing her experience with others. ©FAO/Adarsha Dhungel Facing multiple challenges Nepal’s Churia region, located at the foothills of the mighty Himalayas, is facing serious threats from land degradation, erratic weather patterns and unsustainable human activities. Most farmers in this area are subsistence farmers relying on small plots of cereal crops like rice or maize to feed their families year-round. Many farmers continue traditional crop practices despite rapid climate change, leaving them at greater risk of losing vital harvests to erratic weather. The project, through the farmer field schools is addressing this climate related vulnerability by conducting comparative trials of different crop varieties, tracking their performance throughout the crop cycle and helping farmers identify those best suited to new local conditions and the impacts of climate extremes. These trial plots also serve as a platform for experimenting with new techniques, enabling farmers to observe, adapt and adopt innovative practices in real-world conditions. One of these techniques involves using rice hay as a mulching agent to retain soil moisture in the dry season. Farmers used to burn the hay, which destroyed soil nutrients and beneficial microorganisms and created hazardous air pollution. After adopting this simple mulching technique, the soils retain more water, saving significant amounts of this precious resource. Khilamaya’s training introduced her to techniques to improve yields in small plots. She applied these methods in her own backyard plot, using what little land she had to test and refine her skills. “We used to follow traditional techniques and practices in farming,” she says. “But after being trained in the field school, I have learnt a lot. The resource persons have taught me how to make liquid fertilizer using locally available products... I also learned how to make compost.” Farmer field schools not only introduce modern yet accessible farming techniques, but also ensure that all farmers — including women, men and people with disabilities — can access tools for growth and empowerment. ©FAO/Adarsha Dhungel Building knowledge and agency The farmer field schools not only introduce modern yet accessible farming techniques, but also foster inclusive participation, ensuring that all farmers — including women, men and people with disabilities — can access tools for growth and empowerment. Khilamaya, herself, has lived with a disability since she was six months old. “As you can see, I do not have a right hand, which had caused several difficulties in my daily life,” says Khilamaya. “I particularly found it difficult to write. However, with my left hand, I learnt to write. Although a bit slowly, I can write now.” Not owning her own farmland, she lives in a difficult financial situation, raising two daughters — the younger of whom also lives with a disability. Khilamaya had traditionally been excluded from local programmes or training events because of her disability. However, facilitators of the farmer field school in the village of Risku encouraged her to participate. One Risku field school facilitator, Dev Kumari Raut, recounts how Khilamaya used to be hesitant at first, but gradually increased her participation and proved to be an engaged and determined learner. Khilamaya belongs to the Dalit community of Nepal, who have historically faced social marginalization and caste discrimination. Inclusivity is essential to the project’s success: 49.9 percent of its beneficiaries are from Indigenous Peoples groups and 14.5 percent are from Dalit communities. Additionally, 71 percent of participants in the field schools are women. The project has trained over 2 000 farmers to date and has helped implement climate-resilient farming practices in over 1 200 hectares of farmland. The results have been a dramatic increase in productivity for many farmers. Community-based approaches can help build climate resilience — especially for people who have conventionally been overlooked. After Khilamaya got involved in the farmer field school, her livelihood prospects improved and so did her confidence, proving to herself and others that she is an active and valued member of the community. By engaging traditionally marginalized farmers, the project is not only helping communities become more resilient to climate extremes but also showing that the path to resilience begins by making sure every voice is heard, every person is involved, and everyone has the potential to grow.

      "article_text": "Eusébia Bezerra, a farmer from Brazil, is transforming dry, barren land into a diversified orchard, with sustainable agroforestry practices. ©FAO/ Samuel Salcedo From the highest cloud forest in the Andes to one of the smallest fish in a Chilean river, biodiversity is the invisible thread that ties ecosystems together and sustains agricultural production and food security. Latin America and the Caribbean are home to some of the planet’s greatest biodiversity. The region contains about 50 percent of the world’s primary forests, dubbed “the lungs of the Earth”, for their essential ecosystem functions such as carbon sequestration. Biodiversity, however, is decreasing worldwide due to unsustainable human activity and changes in climate. Meanwhile, the agrifood sector relies on biodiversity and the services it provides, such as soil health, pest and disease control, pollination, regulation of freshwater and genetic resources. Recognizing the importance of biodiversity, particularly within agrifood systems, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), together with the Global Environment Facility (GEF) and other partners, is bolstering conservation efforts throughout Latin America. Here are three GEF-funded, FAO projects conserving and restoring ecosystems across Brazil, Chile and Venezuela: 1. Brazil’s Caatinga biome blossoms again In northeastern Brazil, in the arid landscape of the Caatinga, farmer Eusébia Bezerra is transforming dry barren land into a diversified orchard, with the support of the FAO-led, GEF-financed Sustainable Agroforestry Practices and Biodiversity Conservation project. \"Here before we did not even take advantage of 50 percent of the land, and the project helped us a lot with that. Today we manage to use every corner of the property, with fruit trees, vegetables, flowers and medicinal plants,\" said Eusébia. When she returned to the countryside in 2019, she explained there were no orchards and had to purchase vegetables in the city. When she started her garden, drought was the biggest obstacle. But through the project, the family learned to combine different crops, develop agroforestry systems and reuse water. Today Eusébia and her family sell about 27 kilograms of lettuce, coriander, chives, paprika and leeks each week to a local cooperative. All this is from a system that integrates fruit trees, fish and medicinal plants, generating an additional income for her family. The project’s sustainable agroforestry practices are also helping conserve biodiversity in this Caatinga biome, home to plants such as cacti, thorny trees and shrubs, which are threatened by the advance of monocultures and mining. Because of conservation efforts, Caatinga communities can continue to rely on these plants, such as the mandacaru , a cactus growing edible fruits and the medicinal aroeira tree, for food and medicine. Fishers from Chile developed conservation measures and methods to regulate traditional puye fishing, so that this fish species can continue to reproduce and sustain livelihoods. ©FAO/ Claudio Frías 2. Conservation of Puye fish in Chile In southern Chile, live the puye ( Galaxias maculatus ) - a fish species that has sustained livelihoods for decades. Every spring, local artisanal fishers use traditional techniques to catch this unique fish of high gastronomic and economic value. However, this informal practice threatened fish stocks, marine ecosystems and local livelihoods. \"We sold it illegally because we didn't have the permits to be able to sell it legally,\" says Elizabeth Ovalle, who spent over 30 years extracting the endemic species along the Palena River. The vulnerable status of the puye prompted local fishers to prioritize its conservation and to work with FAO and national and local authorities to develop measures that integrate traditional practices with ones that are both more sustainable and culturally appropriate. The Marine-Coastal Governance project, supported by FAO and GEF, provided data on catch and seasonal patterns, and used these to develop monitoring models for long-term conservation and sustainable use. This effort made it possible to formalize and regulate puye fishing in the Pitipalena - Añihué conservation area for the first time. As a result, between October and December 2024, 4 470 kilos of puye were extracted for sale, a significant increase over the 203 kilos declared the year before. These conservation efforts have not only contributed to a more responsible and sustainable management of the resource but they have bolstered the local economy as well. 3. Rebuilding the home of the frontino bear in Venezuela through reforestation The spectacled bear inhabits the entire Andean mountain range of South America. In Venezuela, it is known as the frontino bear due to the white spots on its forehead. Its presence in the country is declining because of the degradation of its natural habitat. FAO, together with the Ministry of People's Power for Ecosocialism (MINEC) and GEF, implemented a project to restore 5 246 hectares of ecosystems in the Venezuelan Andean region, in the west of the country, so that the frontino bear, other animal species and local communities can live together in harmony. Serfreddy Jerez, a park ranger overseeing the Sierra La Culata National Park, worked on reforestation efforts on agricultural lands adjacent to the park as part of the project. There, MINEC and FAO helped establish community-based tree nurseries in the buffer zones between the forests and agricultural land. \"The most beautiful thing about this is that the people of the community came together,” says the park ranger. “We strove to reforest with our own native trees, which serve as food for the bear and other animals of the area. This is the only way to save our cloud forest.\" Serfreddy is sure that with these reforestation efforts, more frontino bears will roam once more. Beyond reforestation, the project implemented additional measures to safeguard wildlife. With support from the National Foundation of Zoos, Zoobreeders and Aquariums, five ecological corridors have been established in previously fragmented forest areas, allowing fauna, including the frontino bear, to move freely. These corridors contribute to natural regeneration and create sustainable landscape for various species. A reforestation project is restoring 5 246 hectares of ecosystems in the Venezuelan Andes, safeguarding wildlife and creating sustainable landscapes. ©FAO The revitalization efforts across Latin America are helping protect biodiversity and ecosystems, helping achieve the goals of restoring 30 percent of ecosystems by 2030.

In fact, it is their number one source of animal protein. According to their Ministry of Animal and Fisheries Resources, in 2023, Ivorians consumed 23.5 kilos of fish per capita, compared to some 12 kilos of meat. The country currently can’t keep up with demand. In 2023, Côte d’Ivoire produced 92 000 tonnes of fish, but consumed around 534 000 tonnes, having to import the difference. To fill this gap and reduce dependency on imports, the government has made aquaculture a national priority, aiming to increase production from 8 467 tonnes in 2023 to 500 000 tonnes a year by 2030. In comes Diakité Salimata, a 59-year-old fish farmer. Despite being a traditionally male profession, aquaculture is Salimata’s passion. “They say aquaculture is for men, but the more they say something is for men, the more I like that thing,” comments Salimata, adding that her 31-year-old daughter has joined her in the activity. She and her family raise tilapia in four ponds on land she inherited from her father in the Indénié-Djuablin region of the country. The farm also includes cocoa and palm trees as well as chickens, sheep and cows. FAO’s FISH4ACP project is working with Salimata and other fish farmers to increase the country’s production and meet domestic demand. ©FAO/Celeste Diom Aquaculture can be rewarding economically, but you must also have a passion for it, says Salimata. “You can feed yourself and your family with it but if you don’t love it, you will not understand how to make it work,” she explains. This is because aquaculture requires knowledge and skills, such as calculating how much to feed the fish and how to aerate the water. “You have to know what your water levels should be, when to lower the pipes, when to check the dikes,” says Salimata, who refined her skills through capacity building workshops offered by an initiative implemented in her area, FISH4ACP . Her farm was selected through a competitive process as one of 10 pilots of the FISH4ACP project, implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) under the leadership of the Organisation of African, Caribbean and Pacific States and with funding from the European Union and the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development. Aiming to make the aquaculture sector more productive and sustainable, FISH4ACP works with governments to increase national production through capacity building and technical support, with pilot farms serving as models for the rest of the country. Salimata recounts, “I learned about stocking density and how to monitor water temperature and pH levels. I also learned that you need to identify your market before stocking your pond. Because fish must be fed, and aquafeed is expensive. So, you need to be able to sell the fish as soon as they reach market size, or they will cost you even more.” FISH4ACP also provided Salimata with technicians who cleaned her ponds and raised the height of the dikes, planting them with turf to prevent fissures and possible landslides during the rainy season. Salimata, herself, produces up to four tonnes of tilapia per year. She sells it to women fishmongers who come to her farm, and who in turn sell it in local markets and villages. Salimata produces up to four tonnes of tilapia per year, selling it to women fishmongers who in turn sell it in local markets and villages. Increased aquaculture production is helping ensure food security for the country’s growing population and providing a quality source of protein. ©FAO/Celeste Diom The farm is a family affair. While she runs operations, her husband does the accounting, and her daughter is taking on more and more farm duties as her mother ages. Salimata says she sees tilapia farming in her and her family’s future. “For us, this is a long-term activity,” she says. “My daughter will continue it, as will her children and so on.” Along with the other pilots, Salimata’s farm is being supported by FISH4ACP as a model that other farmers can replicate, in support of the government’s production goal of satisfying domestic demand, ensuring food security for its growing population and avoiding expensive imports. “The idea behind FISH4ACP is to showcase a new generation of fish farmers, which can be seen in Salimata and the others. They have will; they have vision. They are also aware of the needs of the country,” says Foungnigué Djire, FAO’s FISH4ACP project lead in Côte d’Ivoire. “When I look at my work, I feel proud. It allows me to provide for my family,” Salimata concludes. Learn more"

Now they are turning this into organic fertiliser, creating a proactive business that converts risks into opportunity. ©FAO/Bibek Dulal In the quiet forests of Nepal's Nawalpur District, a revolution is taking root with the most unlikely tools -- cutters and compost heaps. A group of women in Binayi Triveni are turning what was once one of the region's greatest threats into a promising economic opportunity. At first light, Meena Poudel, 41, bends low beneath the spindly canopy of Sal and Beech trees, her hands rustling through the forest floor's quilt of crisp, bronze-dusted leaves. Their edges are brittle and sun-scoured, curled inward like sleeping insects. Around her, other women move with quiet coordination, slicing through the bramble and deadwood with blades dulled from daily use. The forest breathes easier with each sweep— the tangled underbrush that once fed wildfires now gathered for something new: a slow alchemy into organic fertiliser. Meena’s work has not only built a thriving local economy but has also contributed to a 70 percent reduction in forest fires over the past year. What began as survival has become stewardship, and a local economy built leaf by leaf. \"By removing unnecessary material from the forest floor, we have significantly reduced the risk of fires,” she says. “With fewer fires, the environment has become cleaner, which has also had a direct positive impact on human health. “Additionally, the bio-fertilisers we produce after processing the material are ‘organically pure,’ making them safer for human health and more suitable and environmentally friendly.\" Serving as Secretary, Meena manages the day-to-day operations of the Binayi Community Forest User Group, a community collective dedicated to responsible management of the forest. What she and her colleagues are doing represents a fundamental shift in how communities approach environmental threats. Rather than treating forest fire prevention as merely a defensive measure, they've created a proactive business model that converts risks into opportunity. Their business now produces over 60 000 kilograms annually, with ambitious plans to more than double production to 125 000 kilograms. The organic fertiliser they produce helps local farmers transition away from chemical inputs, improving soil health and crop yields across the region. ©FAO/Bibek Dulal The branches— collected themselves or purchased from local women for two rupees—enter a carefully managed processing cycle. Once collected, the biomass is fed through a cutter that shreds the branches and bushes into smaller pieces, accelerating decomposition. After shredding, the biomass is methodically layered—balancing dry and green materials to ensure optimal conditions—and placed in long, narrow piles known as windrows, which allow organic material to decompose naturally in the open air. The piles are regularly turned to introduce oxygen, while moisture and temperature levels are closely monitored to maintain microbial activity and ensure efficient breakdown over a period of about 90 days. To enhance the process, agriculturally beneficial native microorganisms are added, transforming the compost into an environmentally friendly biofertiliser. The final stabilized product not only provides essential nutrients to plants but also helps restore soil health and microbial biodiversity—key factors in maintaining and improving long-term soil fertility. This seemingly simple process has profound implications. The organic fertiliser they produce helps local farmers transition away from chemical inputs, improving soil health and crop yields across the region. And perhaps most significantly, the business now provides income opportunities for 400 people in an area where employment, particularly for women, has been scarce. The transformation from forest fire risk to enterprise began with local action, but it gained momentum through coordinated support. Investment followed effort. The local municipality matched the group’s initial capital. In 2023, the Forest and Farm Facility (FFF) of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) provided USD 25 000 in catalytic funding. The FFF began by conducting a readiness exercise to assess the group’s potential, then supported training in forest management, composting techniques and market-based value addition. These steps helped ensure the enterprise was not only environmentally sound, but also economically viable. They received support to draft a business plan, conduct market analysis and meet product quality standards. Participation in cross-sectoral meetings helped the women navigate local bureaucracy and build alliances with nearby communities. These combined efforts transformed the group from informal volunteers into credible entrepreneurs. The group’s work has not only built a thriving local economy built on organic fertiliser but has also contributed to a 70 percent reduction in forest fires over the past year. ©FAO/Bibek Dulal Farmers in the region, increasingly wary of the long-term effects of chemical inputs, have turned to Binayi’s organic alternative. Many report not only healthier crops, but also better soil texture and fewer plant diseases. One farmer tested three different fertilisers on the same plot—only Binayi’s compost produced consistent, vigorous growth throughout the season. The enterprise’s impact ripples beyond the forest. Women who once depended on others now fund their children's education. Meena now pays for her son’s bachelor’s degree in Kathmandu, while continuing to manage her household and lead the business from home. Now, Meena says, their work is not just about building their own capacity—but lifting others. “It is not just about developing our own capabilities but also about teaching and empowering others,” she says. “We are actively working to enhance their skills, connect them to the industry and bring more women into leadership positions.” They are not finished. The forest stretches far beyond their community, and they are not yet immune to fire. But each day, their movement grows—one handful of forest debris at a time, one more neighbour trained, one more nursery nourished. A women’s movement that started in one forest now touches six. Soon, they plan to work across 42, reducing forest fires and building economies along the way. Every 16 October - World Food Day - is a chance to celebrate food heroes around the world. From farmers and fishers to innovators and chefs, food heroes are leading local and global efforts to create more sustainable and resilient agrifood systems. But we can all be food heroes: respect food, eliminate waste, reduce unnecessary consumption. Our actions are our future. Let’s build a better one together. Learn more"

      "article_text": "School feeding improves the quality of education and strengthens the ties between families, students and the community, ensuring that healthy eating is both a right and a practice. ©FAO/ Fran Afonso A teacher from El Salvador, a young student from the Dominican Republic and a family farmer from Guatemala have never met, but their life stories are wound around the same cause. They all believe in and work to harness the transformative power of healthy school food. In the community of Concepción de Ataco, in Ahuachapán, El Salvador, what began as an academic assignment for teacher Esmeralda Ruiz became instead a mission: to instil healthy eating habits in her school community. In 2020, Esmeralda participated in a course on the Development of Healthy and Sustainable School Environments. This course was taught with the support of the Sustainable School Feeding Network (RAES) and with the technical assistance of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the government of El Salvador, the Brazilian Cooperation Agency (ABC) and the National Fund for the Development of Education of Brazil within the framework of the Brazil-FAO International Cooperation Program. Esmeralda took this course information and began raising awareness among students and parents about the importance of healthy eating, integrating sustainable practices into the curriculum of the San Francisco Catholic Educational Complex. She organized healthy eating events and fairs at the school with talks designed specifically for parents. Visits to the school garden were also organized where students and their families learned about the benefits of food, the use of ingredients, many of which came from local farmers, and the preparation of healthy recipes. In the garden, children learn about growing food, the importance of a balanced diet and connecting with the environment, while integrating language and math skills into a \"green classroom\". For Esmeralda, \"these actions improve the quality of education and strengthen the ties between families, students and the community, ensuring that healthy eating is both a right and a daily practice.\" Approaching food and nutrition from multiple dimensions, this school is transforming the eating habits of nearly 600 students and their families. The Mata Limón school in the Dominican Republic is one of more than 23 000 in the region that have implemented the Sustainable Schools methodology, within the framework of the Brazil-FAO International Cooperation Program. Left/top: ©FAO/Vanessa Olarte Right/bottom: © Keyla Mariano School gardens inspire Dominican students In the Dominican Republic, young students like Keyla Mariano discovered the value of food by getting their hands dirty in their school garden. Keyla Jasmil Mariano, 13 years old, is a student at the Mata Limón school in Monte Plata, Dominican Republic. When she entered school, she had little interest in the subject of nutrition, but this perspective changed as she became involved in growing food, such as tomatoes and lettuce. \"We see how food is born, the time it takes to produce it and how to take care of it … I think it is very important for schools to have gardens,\" she says enthusiastically. The Mata Limón school is one of more than 23 000 in the region that have implemented the Sustainable Schools methodology, developed by FAO, the Brazilian Cooperation Agency and the National Fund for the Development of Education of Brazil within the framework of the Brazil-FAO International Cooperation Program. With the support of the Dominican Republic’s National Institute of Student Welfare, the methodology includes school gardens and food and nutrition education. Through talks and activities led by teachers, Keyla learned about the production of foods and began to eat vegetables, such as cabbage, that she previously rejected. She now shares her knowledge with friends and family, promoting healthy eating outside of the school environment. In her school, the community actively participates in the management of school feeding, especially parents, thus strengthening the link between education, family and healthy eating. Keyla is one of the 300 students who have learned to value healthy eating thanks to the school garden. Becoming a supplier for the school feeding programme in Guatemala has allowed a network of family farmers to count on a regular income, strengthening their production and revitalizing the local economy. ©FAO/ Elizabeth Castellanos A Market for Family Farming Meanwhile, in Guatemala, family farmer Berbely Rodríguez finds a regular market for her products through school feeding programmes, guaranteeing income for her family while delivering fresh food for thousands of students. In the municipality of Tejutla, department of San Marcos, Guatemala, Berbely is one of 29 farmers who have found a stable source of income by becoming registered with the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food as part of the Network of Tejutleco family farmer suppliers. This regularity has allowed them to strengthen their production and contribute to the revitalization of the local economy of their community. Berbely comments, \"Now I don't see it as difficult because we already have a secure market.\" The Network supplies 131 schools in the municipality. Each school has five producers who plant in stages to meet school demand. \"They are families who have accepted the challenge and have experienced significant economic change. This network changed our history,\" says Berbely. Berbely, her husband and three children collaborate at all stages, from planting the vegetables and aromatic herbs to weekly delivery to the schools for the 36 weeks of the Guatemalan school year. She currently supplies five schools with 697 students. The farmers of the Network are supported by a Joint United Nations Programme, financed by the Swedish International Cooperation Agency and implemented by Guatemala’s Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Food, with technical support from FAO, the United Nations Development Programme, the Pan American Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund. School feeding programmes in Latin America are advancing in the last years with concrete increases in the number of students benefitting (currently around 80.3 million), the number of school days with meal provisions, the number of countries with school feeding laws (now up to six) and stronger connections between school feeding and family farmers. The RAES network has 17 member countries and is working strengthen these programmes with the support of FAO and the Brazilian Government, expanding coverage, guaranteeing higher and continuous funding for these programmes and improving the quality of school meals.

They are knowledge holders and teachers of the younger generations. They have a fundamental role in preserving Indigenous Peoples’ knowledge, agri-food systems, cultures and languages. Rooted in their unique connection to their ancestral lands and territories, they stand at the front lines of defence to protect Indigenous Peoples rights’ and stop the destruction of ecosystems. Indigenous Women live in more than 90 countries around the world. They make unique contributions to the world on food security, biodiversity, medicine, domestication of species and transformation of foods. Yet, all too often, they remain invisible in statistics, decision-making spaces and policies due to the persistent absence of disaggregated data about them and the pervasive discrimination, inequality and systematic refusal to acknowledge their individual and collective rights. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) is working with Indigenous Women and universities to address the data gap and ensure that Indigenous Women are involved in decision-making processes. “At the heart of the strategy is making sure that they’re at the discussion table with policy makers so that their knowledge can positively influence local, national and international spaces,” says Yon Fernandez-de-Larrinoa, Head of the FAO Indigenous Peoples Unit. It’s about ensuring Indigenous Women are visible but also leveraging their crucial roles as knowledge holders. “Indigenous Women are already researchers. However, they must have access to opportunities to make their research and understanding of complex challenges published and shareable. Their knowledge must be recognised if we want to improve food security and nutrition for all,” says Mikaila Way, FAO Coordinator of the Indigenous Women research programme. In 2015, FAO partnered with Indigenous Women’s organizations globally to implement national and regional Indigenous Women Leadership Schools on Human Rights and Food Security – focused on priorities such as land tenure and Free, Prior and Informed Consent . With Indigenous organizations, FAO organized 13 leadership schools at national and regional level, training more than 300 Indigenous women. Many of these women are today involved in international negotiations and processes. Because one powerful global call was to promote Indigenous Women’s academic research, FAO started a partnership Thompson Rivers University (TRU) in Kamloops, British Columbia, Canada to forge a dedicated Knowledge Makers Programme. For a long time, Indigenous Peoples, especially women, were excluded from the world of academic research. “Research used to be done on us as Indigenous Peoples. Back then it was done for us. Then it was done with us, now it is being done by us,” says Rod McCormick, Director of the Indigenous Research Centre at TRU. Through the Knowledge Makers Programme, FAO and TRU facilitated an international research cohort of Indigenous Women focused on Indigenous Peoples’ food and knowledge systems and climate action. 21 Indigenous Women from 16 countries in the seven socio-cultural regions were selected. The result of their research work is gathered in a special volume of the Knowledge Makers Journal . Rosa Marina Flores Cruz (left/top) of the Afro-Binniza Indigenous Peoples focused her study on the proliferation of wind farms in Mexico and the consequences they have on her community’s territory. Melanie M. Kirby (right/bottom) discusses the importance of pollinator conservation in land stewardship and explains that the need for re-Indigenization, referring to returning to practices with Indigenous Peoples roots. Left/top: © Rosa Marina Flores Cruz. Right/bottom: © Melanie M. Kirby Rosa Marina Flores Cruz, a member of the Afro-Binniza Indigenous Peoples from Oaxaca, Mexico, focused her research on the proliferation of wind farms and the serious consequences they have on her community’s territory, despite claims that these advance “sustainable development”. “Women were almost completely displaced from the agreements and signing of lease contracts with the wind energy companies. They were isolated from decision-making because very few had the status of being possessors of the land; persuasive efforts were instead focused on men. But in response, from the beginning we, Indigenous Women, have been involved in the defence of the territory,” says Flores Cruz. Mariiam Tambieva of the Karachay and Balkar Indigenous People in Russia’s North Caucasus, draws attention to her Peoples’ zero-waste lifestyles and traditional practices that were employed out of a respect for nature but are now being “re-discovered” under the drive for sustainability. “Even though Karachays and Balkars never used the term ‘zero-waste’, we have lived according to this philosophy for centuries,” she says. They used all components of the animal from the meat, bones and offal to cook different food and preserves. As households are the main producers of food waste, she explains, turning to these practices could play a significant part in minimizing losses. “Practicing methods used in Indigenous Peoples’ communities can be easy; we only need to read and learn about them and share experiences,” concludes Tambieva. Mariiam Tambieva of the Karachay and Balkar Indigenous People draws attention to her Peoples’ zero-waste lifestyles as a model for households to follow. © Mariiam Tambieva As a Pollinator Specialist, Melanie M. Kirby, from the Tortugas Pueblo in New Mexico, United States of America, discusses “Re-Indigenization” and the importance of pollinator conservation in land stewardship. “Beekeeping connects us to our origins as fellow beings of light, as a part of this land, not separate from it,” she says. She explains that the term re-Indigenization refers to returning to practices with Indigenous Peoples roots, rediscovering our relationship with nature and the land. “Focusing on re-Indigenizing approaches to stewardship and conservation can help to amplify disenfranchised and marginalized knowledge systems that were developed through millennia,” Kirby states. In her work, Kirby refers to the concept of consilience, where the knowledge from different fields can be combined to create a unified understanding of the world. FAO’s approach involves creating spaces where the complementary nature of Indigenous Peoples’ food and knowledge systems and formal science can combine to confront some of the serious issues our planet faces, such as biodiversity loss and food insecurity. Ensuring that Indigenous Women share their wisdom through academic research is central to leveraging their oral knowledge, which has been gathered over thousands of years in more than 5 000 Indigenous Peoples communities around the world. This knowledge can and should influence global discussions and offer solutions to today’s challenges. Learn more"

That neatly sums up her commitment and contribution to addressing the growing problem of conflict between humans and wildlife. Chipo works as a Resource Monitor in northern Zimbabwe with the Mucheni Community Conservancy, which is being established with support from the Sustainable Wildlife Management (SWM) Programme. In addition to wildlife management, the Programme also encourages the planting of trees and spreads knowledge about the value of preserving them. Chipo says the job has opened her mind, as she sets about “educating the community on how to live with their animals and how to live with their trees.” Populations of many wildlife species in Zimbabwe have been declining over the last 30 years due to consecutive droughts, habitat loss, poaching and sale of wildlife products. At the same time, human–wildlife conflict, whether it’s elephants trampling villagers’ crops or lions and hyenas savaging farmers’ cattle, continues to present multiple challenges for rural communities. The main approach of the SWM Programme to tackling these issues is supporting community conservancies, which promote improved land use planning and effectiveness of wildlife corridors to reduce conflict and create benefits for communities that coexist with wildlife. Run by the communities themselves, conservancies provide safe spaces and corridors for wildlife through habitat protection and anti-poaching efforts. They also promote community-led natural resource management, securing land tenure and benefit sharing, while helping communities develop the skills to tap into new sources of income through activities like ecotourism, wildlife-based enterprises and sustainable natural resource harvesting. The SWM Programme is funded by the European Union with co-funding from the French Facility for Global Environment and the French Development Agency. It is implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the Centre for International Forestry Research and World Agroforestry (CIFOR-ICRAF), the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS) and the French Agricultural Research Centre for International Development (CIRAD). Its aim is to improve wildlife conservation and food security in 15 African, Caribbean and Pacific countries. The Mucheni Community Conservancy is part of the Programme’s work in the Kavango Zambezi (KAZA) Transfrontier Conservation area, which straddles five countries (Angola, Botswana, Namibia, Zambia and Zimbabwe), and is implemented in Zimbabwe by CIRAD in coordination with national and local authorities.

In the Mucheni Community Conservancy, the level of awareness and knowledge about wildlife management has significantly increased as she and her fellow Resource Monitors have been reporting and responding to incidents of human-wildlife conflict. They have also engaged local communities in an innovative participatory mapping game to help identify and agree on how to tackle wildlife conflict. Chipo works to promote human-wildlife conflict mitigation measures such as using special enclosures called “mobile bomas”, which are made of canvas or polyester to help keep livestock safe from predators. She and her fellow monitors are also helping restock the area with wildlife and reduce the threats from poaching. Since 2022, recorded incidents of poaching, encroachment and illegal clearing in forested areas in the Mucheni Conservancy have dropped by 46 percent. Chipo engages with villagers, explaining the benefits of community conservancies as part of her awareness-raising efforts on sustainable wildlife management. ©FAO/DavidMansell-Moullin As well as helping her community, Chipo’s income from her work as a Resource Monitor has also benefited her own family. “I am paying school fees for my younger brother. I am using the money that I am getting from my job as a Resource Monitor. The money allowed me to buy goats and a female cow. I gave her a name that is ‘gift’ similar to my name.” She also says many other women in the community have seen her as a role model for her engagement in a male-dominated field. Chipo is amongst eight female resource monitors supported by the Programme. “Chipo has demonstrated to us women in this community that it is feasible to participate in male-dominated professions like resource monitoring,\" says fellow monitor, Rejoice Ncube. So whether from a professional or a personal perspective, Chipo’s work offers a positive example of interaction with wildlife and a source of inspiration within the community that surrounds her.

      "article_text": "Biodiversity, whether through diverse local seeds or pollinators that are vital for a range of crops and wild plants, is at the core of agrifood systems. ©FAO/ Helen Lugada Whether it’s using indigenous seeds that are more resilient, combining coffee crops with banana plants or restoring pollinator populations, biodiversity is not an abstract concept tossed around by scientists and activists. It is a whole range of concrete practices that farmers put into action in their daily work in a way which is crucial to food security and the environment. Our agrifood systems rely on thousands of species of domesticated crops, livestock, fish and the varieties, breeds and strains that ensure their genetic diversity. In addition, at least 50 000 wild species are used globally for food, energy, medicine, materials and other purposes. But biodiversity is declining worldwide, driven by changing land use, climate change, and over-exploitation, putting the future of food at risk. In Luweero District, Uganda, coffee and banana farmer Jane Nakandi Sebyaala, also runs the Twezimbe Kassala Community Seed Bank. Its mission is to preserve indigenous seeds, a foundational element of keeping the range of biodiverse crops in fields. According to Jane, indigenous seeds can be replanted up to ten times, unlike fortified seeds which need to be replaced annually, and can flourish without pesticides or large quantities of fertilizer. Jane says it used to be hard to find indigenous seeds in the shops and markets. But after the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) organized a training for farmers on the benefits of these seeds, “we began to reach out to village elders to collect these indigenous seeds, and we started planting them.” Over time, Jane and her fellow farmers were able to grow significant quantities of crops such as indigenous varieties of maize and beans. “The advantage of these indigenous seeds is their resilience. They are disease resilient and less susceptible to pests compared to commercial crops,” she says. From the FAO trainings, John (left/top) has learned biodiversity-friendly techniques to fight pests. ©FAO/ Helen Lugada Pests are just one of the problems faced by Ugandan coffee farmer John Kagwa Tujjunge. Spraying pesticides on them is not only costly but also harms biodiversity, including bee populations, other insects and earthworms, not to mention affecting the precious coffee cherries. So, to deal with pests like the black coffee twig borer, which dries out the coffee twigs, “we’ve tried to fight them with traps.” Learning from FAO trainings, John has also put more emphasis on removing weeds and unproductive branches which provide a breeding ground for pests. Additionally, he uses locally available materials such as soap, water and ethanol to attract pest insects. “Very simple, but very effective,” John says. An equally significant issue is the longstanding water shortage, exacerbated by deforestation and climate change. “We suffer a lot during the dry season. The coffee nearly dries out. That’s why we dig drainage channels in the garden to preserve water for the coffee during droughts.” He’s been interplanting bananas with his coffee trees as part of an agroforestry system to improve the health and sustainability of his crops. These banana plants protect the coffee from direct sunshine and keep the soil moist, encouraging small insects, earthworms and other organisms to aerate the earth by tunneling, allowing for simple water percolation even during light showers. Mulch also attracts termites and aids in soil decomposition, which improves soil fertility. In addition, the coffee blooms attract other natural pollinators including bees and butterflies. All these practices have helped increase the yield from John’s 1.2 acres from roughly 90 kilograms of coffee to between 480 and 720 kilograms of coffee annually. Also, he can harvest coffee pretty much throughout the year, as opposed to just seasonally. Pollination is also a key preoccupation for Wilson Kabagambe, who leads a beekeeping project supported by FAO in Uganda’s Nakaseke District. Before the FAO Farmer Field School trainings, he says, “You’d find somebody with a big acreage of maize, but with many dented cobs, signifying that there was no pollination or insufficient pollination.” With coffee, Wilson says, it was a similar story “you could find the berries empty-seeded. That would signify that there was no pollination.” Destruction of the natural habitats of bees and the widespread use of chemicals had reduced the population of bees and other pollinators and the result was obvious. Addressing this pollination shortage, the FAO project, “Mainstreaming Biodiversity across Agricultural Sectors to implement the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework” , worked to build bee hives, offering artificial breeding nests for honeybees. So far, the project supplied over 500 beehives in the Nakaseke area. The action to reintroduce pollinators boosted crop production, while the honey and other bee byproducts also provided farmers with an additional income source. Mainstreaming good practices is key to boosting biodiversity and acknowledging its importance across the global agrifood sector. ©FAO/ Helen Lugada Biodiversity, whether through diverse local seeds or pollinators that help grow a range of crops and wild plants, is at the core of agrifood systems and at the heart of the work of farmers. FAO is working to mainstream biodiversity into agricultural policies and practices in various countries including Uganda, the Lao People’s Democratic Republic and Madagascar. As part of this project on biodiversity, FAO organized a “Learning Journey” to help farmers and agricultural specialists learn biodiverse practices from each other. Standardizing these good practices is key to boosting biodiversity and acknowledging its importance across the agrifood sector globally. Learn more"

      "article_text": "In the farming community of rural Homs, a transformative initiative has taken place. With generations of unequal social norms, women and girls in many rural areas in Syria are subjected to different forms of discrimination and social injustice. Early marriage and economic disadvantage are core examples of this issue, and many women find themselves lacking the knowledge needed to become empowered as a result of being denied their education. To address these challenges, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has been implementing two innovation pilot projects on the prevention of Violence Against Women and Girls (VAWG) in Homs and Rural Damascus governorates under the ‘Building Local Resilience in Syria (BLRS)’ project. The pilot projects are funded by UK Aid and implemented in collaboration with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). At the heart of these pilots are Dimitra Clubs (DC), safe spaces where rural community members, opinion leaders, and community influencers, engage in meaningful dialogue about common issues, build their skills in peaceful conflict resolution, and seek solutions for the community’s best interest. In Tal Dahab, a village in Homs governorate, women used the DC platform to discuss and highlight their need for basic literacy and arithmetic skills. FAO responded by launching a literacy course designed to help women farmers better manage their finances. Transforming Lives Through Education The literacy course has had a profound impact on participants, as the essential reading and calculation skills they learned have empowered them to manage their lives better, and hope for a brighter future. “I am now more self-reliant than before,” said Nofa Hamada, a mother of three and a participant in this course. “When buying from the shop, I can now read price labels and add up costs to make sure I’m paying the right price. My husband is missing, and my children are all of school going age; it is very important to be careful with my spending so that I can pay for their education,” she adds. For Amina Esber, a land laborer and the breadwinner for her family, the literacy sessions have offered greater control over her finances: “Before, I had no idea if the money I received was correct. Now, I can count my wages and make sure I am not being cheated.” Amina’s newfound confidence extends to her role as a mother. Her 20-year-old son, who was deprived of basic education due to suffering from epilepsy since his birth, is now benefiting from the lessons Amina brings home: “We study together,” she said. “He deserves a chance in life,” Amina continued. Moreover, Amina can see the impact of this course on her personality, as she explains: “I can read the road signs and know that I am on the right path wherever I go. This makes me feel safer and more confident.” The transformative impact has inspired these women to think beyond personal gains. “I now realize how literacy could change women’s lives,” Nofa noted: “If I had a proper education, I could have found a job and relied on myself, so I will make sure my daughters get an education.” Nofa adds. She hopes the Dimitra Club meetings will also provide skill-building opportunities that could generate additional income for the women. More than words The Dimitra Clubs have equipped women farmers with literacy skills and also served as a platform to discuss social issues, such as early marriage as a form of violence against women and girls. Through these meetings, women have found emotional support and solidarity. Khitam Othman, who has supported her family alone since her husband went missing 13 years ago, shared her experience of being married at 13 years old and has come away with a transformed view on life: “I did not have the education to adequately provide for my family when my husband disappeared. I will not rush my daughter into marriage because I know from my own experience that her education comes first. She will only marry when she finds someone who respects her,” she elaborates. The VAWG innovation pilot projects target 3 000 individuals overall across 31 locations in Homs and Rural Damascus governorates through discussion, social cohesion, and empowerment activities. In addition to Dimitra Clubs, the prevention of VAWG pilots target couples at the household level through the Discussion Group Series (DGS) activity, a series of facilitated discussions focused on joint decision making and peaceful resolution of disagreements between couples engaged in agriculture. Together, these modalities express FAO’s commitment to empowering rural women at both the household and community levels, fostering greater equality, reduced violence, and enhanced agency for women and girls over their lives.

      "article_text": "Nino Kavtaradze’s skills and experience processing fruits and making cheeses provided her with income for vital cancer treatment and equipped her to act as Lead Farmer in an FAO initiative. ©FAO/Guram Saqvarelidze For Nino Kavtaradze, the income which she makes using her skills and decades of experience producing dried fruits, jams and distinctive Georgian cheeses has literally meant the difference between sickness and health. Nearly 20 years ago, she explains, “I was diagnosed with a severe disease – cancer,” Nino says. “The sales of dried fruits and tklapi [sheets of dried fruit puree which roll up like leather] was one of the key income sources which supported my health, covering my medical fees.” She spent years undergoing multiple rounds of chemotherapy. All the while, she says that she concentrated on running her home-based business in the country’s northwestern mountains to keep her mind busy on the day-to-day. This focus and honing her expertise allowed her to play a key role as a Lead Farmer in a project which aims to improve the resilience and economic empowerment of smallholder women dairy farmers. That came about when she met a fellow cheese producer who was running a Farmer Field School, as part of an initiative implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in partnership with the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women) and funded by the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation. She asked Nino if she would be interested in doing the same - and if so, could she find 15 women to take part? The determination that had helped her overcome cancer kicked in and she did more than that. Nino found 30 local women dairy farmers who were interested in participating in the FAO Farmer Field School, where farmers learn from each other, with the technical guidance of FAO food technologists, agronomists and veterinarians. The school covers a range of subjects from food safety, animal care and vaccinations to the production of new types of dairy and processed fruit and vegetables, as well as business management and gender equality. Although she has worked as dairy farmer for 30 years, Nino still gained new knowledge from the FAO Farmer Field School, which she hosted in her home for 30 women farmers. ©FAO/Guram Saqvarelidze Based on the knowledge shared by FAO, the women exchanged experiences on animal management, milk and dairy production, hygiene and modern food safety practices. Nino says that even though she has worked as a dairy farmer for 30 years, she still gained useful new knowledge from the trainings. The basic equipment provided to her by FAO has also boosted production, safety and competitiveness. Nino is especially happy with the FAO-provided grinding mill, which saves her money as she no longer has to buy processed animal feed. “We will not have to buy corn since we have corn fields, and I will somehow manage to purchase wheat and barley. When we grind the grains, feeding our livestock will not be as costly and our profits will increase.” FAO also provided Nino with small dairy production equipment such as a milk pasteurizer, a vacuum sealer and specialized containers. With these, she has taken her cheese production to a whole new level, offering her own brand of Ninoseuli (which translates as “Ninoian”) innovative cheese varieties. “I wanted my cheeses to stand out,” Nino highlights, “This is why I added dried fruits to my products and started creating cheese with dried figs, plums and kiwi.” By partnering with Nino and her fellow Lead Farmers, FAO has helped more than 600 smallholder women dairy farmers to produce a range of cheese varieties ©FAO/Guram Saqvarelidze Another “Ninoian” experiment was making sweet jams with spicy peppers. Nino has taken her cheeses and pepper jams to various exhibitions, where consumers have shown great interest in these new products. “The pepper jam and cheese go well with each other,” says Nino as she recalls her experience at the Unique Georgian Taste. This agromarket, which FAO organizes in Tbilisi and other cities in Georgia through assistance from the European Union and Sweden, supports producers of niche and terroir products. Once Nino’s customers tried the combination, “they liked it and this is how I sold cheese in greater quantities, while those who bought the pepper jam once, returned to buy more.” By partnering with Nino and her fellow Lead Farmers, FAO has helped more than 600 women dairy farmers to produce a range of cheese varieties, from caciotta to halloumi. Many of them have started producing these cheeses commercially. “When a person sets a goal,” says Nino, “they must try their best to achieve it. I did not give up for a single second or think about dying when I had cancer. I am here now because I battled my way through with work, determination and motivation.” With this attitude, Nino continues producing unique and ever more popular “Ninoian” products for the Georgian market and inspiring more and more farmers to follow her example.

      "article_text": "The jackfruit was Bangladesh’s natural choice for the FAO One Country One priority product initiative, which helps countries identify and maximise the market potential of certain national products. ©FAO/Saikat Mojumder Khadiga Khanom never used to give much thought to jackfruit. In her home district of Gazipur, about 50 kilometres north of the Bangladeshi capital Dhaka, Khadiga had certainly seen plenty of jackfruit trees in her life. They are hard to miss, as oblong, spiky green fruits, which can easily each weigh several kilos. She had even cooked jackfruit in her curries along with an array of other ingredients. But she never imagined that one day it would become one of the main sources of her family’s livelihood. It all came about after the 37-year-old homemaker took part in a series of workshops and trainings where she learned how to process a whole range of products that can be made from the jackfruit. With this training provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), she soon decided to take a leap of faith and start her own business. Today, she produces an array of jackfruit-based goods, including pickles, jam, burgers, cakes, pizzas and even plant-based leather. Processing about 100 kilograms of jackfruit daily, with five employees in a specially equipped room in her home, she’s able to earn an income of about USD 400 a month. She proudly shares that the money is “helping me support my family, and I'm even saving up to expand the business. I never thought jackfruit would change my life like this.” The learnings were part of the FAO One Country One Priority Product (OCOP) initiative which helps countries identify the products that have the most market potential and provides support in maximising it. For Bangladesh, the world’s second-largest producer of jackfruit, this was a natural choice. Jackfruit is also the country’s national fruit and symbolizes abundance. Yet much of the potential of this fruit remained untapped. Outdated subsistence farming methods and post-harvest losses due to poor storage have led to many jackfruit rotting before reaching markets. Producers Kazi Md. Fazlul Huq (left/top) and Monowara Begum (right/bottom) show off their jackfruits. Training in modern farming and production techniques helped to increase yields and prevent fruit from rotting before it reached markets. ©FAO/Kazi Riasat. For Ramij Uddin, a farmer in Sreepur Upazila in central Bangladesh, jackfruit has always been part of his life. But like many Bangladeshi farmers, who relied on traditional farming techniques, his yields were often inconsistent and low-quality. It was in 2023 that Ramij participated in FAO’s training session and learned modern production techniques, including the proper use of manure, fertilizers and pest control. Thereafter, his results were impressive. By the next harvest season, his jackfruit trees produced 30 percent more fruit. The size, shape and colour of the jackfruits had also improved significantly, allowing him to sell them at more than double the previous year’s price. “I never imagined I could earn this much from jackfruit,” he says. “Now, I feel proud when I take my produce to the market because I know it’s the best quality. This training has completely changed how I farm.” With modern production techniques, post-harvest handling and processing methods, Ramij and other farmers are seeing the results of the OCOP initiative. It’s not just about growing more jackfruit—it’s about growing better-quality jackfruit, which in turn means higher incomes and improved livelihoods. The jackfruit is reaching wider markets both at home and abroad, helping farmers and all those along the value chain improve their livelihoods. ©FAO/Kazi Riasat Since Bangladesh joined the OCOP initiative in 2022, the FAO trainings have benefited not just farmers but all those involved in the process of jackfruit production. The focus has been on the \"green\" development of the jackfruit value chain, integrating climate smart and environmentally friendly practices, emphasizing innovation in production, storage, processing and marketing. There’s still some way to go. For Bangladeshi jackfruit to enjoy increased market access, its production will require more modernization, like vacuum packaging, and adherence to international standards. But already, with FAO’s support to maximise the jackfruit’s potential, local farmers and entrepreneurs are proving that it can open doors to better livelihoods. Local markets are now brimming with a variety of jackfruit products, from snacks to desserts, which not only cater to local tastes but also attract interest from broader international markets.

      "article_text": "The Berd Bean Women’s Association formed as part of LEAD programme supported by FAO and UNDP, with funding from the European Union. ©FAO/Hayk Hovhannisyan. Nestled in the town of Berd, in the picturesque Tavush region of Armenia, a group of women are proving the power of sisterhood. Much like the beans they cultivate, these women are strong, and their bonds are deeply rooted. Beans have long been a staple of rural life, symbolizing resilience in agricultural communities. They are often associated with humble, but nourishing meals, especially during the winter months and in times of religious fasting. Passed down through generations, the cultivation and harvesting of beans is a shared heritage, representing patience, care and hard work. Anahit Paytyan, Alina Paytyan and Varduhi Melikbekyan each bring their unique strengths and experiences to their group, known as the \"Berd Bean\" Women’s Association. This group formed as part of the “Local Empowerment of Actors for Development” (LEAD) programme supported by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), with funding from the European Union. The LEAD programme trained the women in essential business management and marketing techniques, providing them opportunities to share mutually beneficial learnings. ©FAO/Hayk Hovhannisyan. Anahit Paytyan, one of the association’s members, begins her day at 4:30 AM, tending to her fields. She is reassured by the fact that she is not alone in her efforts: Alina, Lusine, Anna, and Mariam are all working on their own plots of land, dotted around the region. One of the primary difficulties women farmers in Armenia face is fragmented landholdings. Small, scattered plots make it harder for the women to achieve economies of scale and limits their ability to access larger markets or invest in labour-saving technologies. However, through their association, the women now pool their efforts not only in cultivating their beans but also in marketing them and negotiating better prices for essential agricultural inputs. They learned many of these skills through the LEAD programme, where they were trained in essential business management and marketing techniques. They also participated in networking events, enabling them to share their experiences. Together, the women navigate obstacles, such as small, scattered plots that make it hard for the women to achieve economies of scale or invest in labour-saving technologies. ©FAO/Hayk Hovhannisyan Overcoming challenges together From soil preparation and planting to weeding and harvesting, bean farming requires significant manual labour. Each stage demands careful attention, especially in smaller-scale farms where mechanization is not employed. Bean plants are also sensitive to overcrowding and pests, more elements that demand attention. With peer support, the women navigate these obstacles, finding creative solutions together. The association allows them to share resources, reduce costs and build confidence. By pooling their strengths and working as a team, the women are now accessing the larger markets inaccessible to them before. Together, the women have also formed agreements with regional supermarkets, and they are exploring options for export as they increase their production. With plans to establish a bean cleaning centre, the association is positioning itself to meet market demands, ensuring that their products are processed, cleaned and packaged efficiently. The \"Berd Bean\" Women’s Association is planning to expand their activities, bringing more women farmers into their fold. Through their association, they are not only improving their own livelihoods but also inspiring other women in the region to come together and find strength in their shared experiences, driving change in rural economies. Just as the beans they cultivate have taken root and grown, so too has the confidence and independence of the women of Berd. Learn more"

Assisting farmers in developing their businesses, farmer field schools are an integral part of Kenya’s National Agricultural and Rural Inclusive Growth Project, financed by the World Bank and designed and implemented with the support of FAO’s Investment Centre. ©FAO/Peter Safari For a few months now, Esther Munani Kyalo’s routine has changed. A mother of three living in the Miambani ward in Kitui county, Kenya, she has followed a new ritual every Tuesday since the Kavakaky Farmer Field School was launched. Together with around 35 other women from her area, she walks to a nearby house where the group meets and breeds chicks in the small but brand-new poultry house. Sitting under a large mango tree, surrounded by the beautiful hills of this area, the community gathers to discuss, observe, learn and make decisions to improve their husbandry practices. A few kilometres from there, Josphat Muthui Kangata starts his day with a tea, before tending to his crops, goats, and for a few months now, bees. A few plastic chairs behind the house of the 72-year-old farmer accommodate a group of honey producers every Friday. Facilitated by Ruth Kavinya, a community-based farmer, the sessions’ objective is to improve the quality and quantity of the honey they produce. In Kenya, livestock production, including beekeeping and chicken brooding, plays an important socioeconomic role. In the country’s arid and semi-arid lands, such as Kitui, it accounts for as much as nine-tenths of a family’s income. Transitioning from family farming to commercialization can significantly enhance farmer incomes and reduce rural poverty. In that, Farmer Field Schools play an integral part. Through its Investment Centre, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) helped design and supported the implementation of Kenya’s National Agricultural and Rural Inclusive Growth (NARIG) project , financed by the World Bank's International Development Association . The Centre promoted country-wide use of farmer field schools to build long-term capacity of farming communities, with the project reaching almost 300 000 farmers in eight years.

Right/bottom: Josphat produces honey through the traditional wooden beehives. ©FAO/Peter Safari Even though the field school session lasts for three to four hours, and the wind gets hotter, Esther is constantly smiling. For her, attending these sessions is a way to improve her business and to strengthen her community. The sessions are designed to empower participants in selecting and implementing new technologies, innovations and management practices. Beyond new knowledge, farmer field schools are often a way for farmers to produce or sell their products together and to have better access to information and innovation. The group divides into three, and each sub-group conducts a livestock analysis, which involves observing, measuring and collecting data on the animals' weight, height and health. Esther’s group chooses to focus their work on different feeds and the impact it has on a chicks’ health and growth. Once the data is gathered, each group presents its findings, discusses them with the larger group and suggests actions, such as choosing the best type of feed. Addressing real challenges Before the field schools, both Esther and Josphat were experiencing difficulties on their farms. “Many chickens were dying, and those who survived grew very slowly. It was very hard to get a decent income from chicken brooding as we could sell very few,” says Esther. With knowledge gained from the field school, she introduced new feed, learnt about vaccination and bought new equipment. And the results speak for themselves: “Before, I had between 10 to 15 chickens. Now I have 295.” She is now proud to be a “renowned poultry seller” in the area and is determined to keep going. Josphat, on the other hand, was already producing some honey but selling it at a very low price, given its poor quality. Yields were low, due to the destruction or escape of some bees during harvesting. With slight modifications to the traditional log hive, their honey is now pure. “Before, we would package merged honey and honeycomb and sell it at KES 80 (USD 0.62) a kilo. Since the onset of the programme where we learnt to harvest pure honey, we sell a kilo at KES 1 000 (USD 7.80). Beekeeping has become our exclusive source of revenue.” With new bee feeding and watering techniques, pest control and safety practices, Josphat’s group has increased their beehives from seven to 48. As a partnership between FAO, governments and funders like the World Bank, field schools allow farmers to turn technologies and technical expertise into great impacts for their livelihoods. ©FAO/Peter Safari Part of the community In Kitui county alone, more than 400 field schools have been formed. Gustavus Mwambui Muli, a government extension officer and the project’s master trainer in Kitui, has trained 105 farmer field school facilitators. “When you bring new practices, farmers are a bit sceptical. Through field schools, you give the farmers the opportunity to test them, compare them, so they can make informed decisions,” says Muli. He already sees the impacts of the NARIG project: “Some farmers were selling chicks once a year, now they can sell three times a year because they adopted a faster growing breed or chose better feed for the animal to grow faster and be sold earlier. Seeing the way the field schools has influenced the lives of people is a great source of satisfaction.” An FAO flagship tool, farmer field schools have been implemented in Kenya on a large scale through the NARIG project. “The use of farmer field schools came in handy because we were able to train community-based farmers as facilitators in 21 counties. All over the country, around 11 000 field schools were implemented, reaching almost 300 000 farmers,” recounts Mary Maingi, National Coordinator of NARIG’s community development. Farmer field schools have been implemented in more than 90 countries in the world since the late 1980s. As a partnership between FAO, governments and international financial institutions such as the World Bank, field schools allow farmers to harness technologies and technical expertise and turn these into great impacts on their farms and livelihoods.

Their task: to find and collect pianguas, a type of saltwater clam, that lives buried within the roots of mangrove trees in the Pacific region of Colombia. Reaching the pianguas is no easy endeavour. They must find the right place to anchor, always a different spot from their last harvest, to ensure sustainability. Magnolia then jumps overboard, climbs a wall of mud and walks as far as possible into the mangrove forest, jumping and weaving through long roots. She lights incense to ward off mosquitoes and takes a moment to sing to the mangroves, thanking them for the food they provide. Then, she wades through the mud, sometimes reaching above her knees, to carefully dig up the clams. With each piangua she unearths, she checks its size and takes only the mature ones.

      "article_text": "Through a GEF-funded FAO project, women in Kazakhstan receive hands-on training on successful greenhouse cultivation and sustainable agriculture. ©FAO/Didar Salimbayev The eyes of Aishagul Duganova, a 48-year-old mother of three, light up as she talks about her new greenhouse, which is bringing with it a new stability amidst her family's health problems and money troubles. In the village of Koram, around 150 kilometers east of Almaty in Kazakhstan, Aishagul's life has been marked by her husband’s debilitating injury and the severe illnesses of her elderly parents-in-law. With her family completely reliant on her, Aishagul was caught between the demanding care they required and the necessity to earn money; yet she was unable to take advantage of work opportunities too far from home. Before her husband's accident, Aishagul worked with him in the field, and they sold their produce in local markets. But as his condition worsened, she could no longer leave him alone, pushing the family into a cycle of debt to cover medical expenses and sustain their children. \"Every day, I had to make a choice— care for my sick family or leave them behind to work. It was a choice no one should have to make,\" Aishagul shares, her voice tinged with the fatigue of years of caregiving. A turning point came when Aishagul's sister-in-law, aware of her dire situation, introduced her to a greenhouse harvesting training programme. This initiative was part of the broader Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) project, known as CACILM-2, and funded by the Global Environmental Facility (GEF). Among its objectives, the project equips rural women in Kazakhstan with the skills and resources to adopt sustainable farming practices and make a living from agriculture. Thanks to the training course provided by FAO’s partner, the Local Community Foundation of Enbekshikazakh District, Aishagul has improved her vegetables and produce-growing skills, allowing her to independently cultivate food. Pavel Kavunov, an agronomist working at the Foundation, explained the training offered by the project: \"We focused on practical, climate-smart agriculture techniques that ensure these women can produce quickly and sustainably.” He imparted information on the characteristics of seedlings, their root systems and important aspects to consider during planting. “It’s about giving them the tools and the knowledge to succeed on their own terms,\" he added. This local expert presence ensures that the women farmers are not only trained but also have continual access to advice and problem-solving techniques, which is vital for the sustainability of their agricultural activities. Working with an FAO project that provided a greenhouse, Aishagul Duganova is now able to grow vegetables year-round in her backyard and support her family. ©FAO/Didar Salimbayev FAO also worked with Aishagul and nine other women to install 100 square metre, tunnel greenhouses on their lands. This collaboration has empowered them to cultivate vegetables all year-round in their backyards, opening the door to economic independence and lasting stability. As the women learn to manage their micro-farms, they are supported by a network of agronomists and coordinators, such as Bakytgul Yelchibayeva, who assist them in connecting with local markets and buyers. \"Our goal is to go beyond providing initial support by creating a lasting infrastructure that enables these women to thrive independently,” she explains. Aishagul is now making the most of her new greenhouse, growing cucumbers and other vegetables to support her family. \"This greenhouse has changed everything. It allows me to be with my family when they need me and still provide for them,\" she explains. Encouraged by her success, Aishagul hopes to build a sustainable farm that also helps other women in her community learn and grow together. In addition to the greenhouse, the project supported women farmers with tillage materials and cucumber seeds. Together, the women sold 3 992 kilograms of produce, earning roughly double what they would typically make. The boost in income from this extra produce helped improve the lives of 64 people, strengthening their community's farming efforts. By empowering rural women with tools and knowledge to undertake agricultural ventures, FAO is promoting equality of opportunity, enhancing women’s economic stability and independence. ©FAO/Didar Salimbayev The CACILM-2 project is providing targeted training, resources and coaching to rural communities in Central Asia, addressing several critical barriers such as inadequate job opportunities and lack of information. Moreover, through partnerships with local foundations and experts, participants forge connections with local markets and introduce their products to potential buyers, ensuring a reliable outlet for their produce.

      "article_text": "A reddish variety of potato called UNICA is now growing in Esther Murugi’s land in Laikipia County, Kenya. With this change, advised by an FAO-UN WOMEN project, her production has ballooned. ©FAO Among the various types of potatoes grown all over the world, there is a particular reddish variety called UNICA, growing in Esther Murugi’s half an acre of land in Laikipia County, Kenya. Named after the University of Ica in southern Peru, where UNICA was initially released in the 1990s, this variety is now being grown by potato farmers across the globe. And Esther’s farmland is one of those places. In a field sprinkled with purple blossoms, she walks around her farm and digs out some soil around a UNICA potato. It is barely three months, yet the tubers are big enough to be harvested, Esther mentions contently. This isn’t even her first harvest, and she has plenty left over from her previous harvest. Her family will have enough to eat through to the next harvest without worrying. Although, this wasn’t always the case. “Before the introduction of this variety, potato farming, which is our mainstay, had declined, not that we were not planting. We were planting but the harvest was very little – few small tubers. Now you can see the results by yourself,” explains Esther. The UNICA variety can be grown on both lowlands and highlands, reaches maturity early and has the ability to resist water, heat stress and many diseases, like the potato late blight fungus. ©FAO Potatoes are not only a staple food source but a livelihood for many farmers in Laikipia. In this region, the climate is generally arid and semi-arid with minimal rains. Farmers faced constant challenges due to inadequate seeds and the short seasonality of the potato crop. This led to the recycling of poor-quality potato seeds to propagate the crop and resulted in the continuation of diseases and pests. When droughts befell the lands, these problems were exacerbated. In 2020, to help women farmers adapt to the changing climate and increase their crop yields, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) along with the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN WOMEN), with funding from the Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA), implemented a climate-smart project. The Women Economic Empowerment through Climate-Smart Agriculture (WEE-CSA) project was carried out in the three counties - Laikipia, Kitui and West Pokot. Among the several value chain improvements that were promoted through the project, one was the introduction of the UNICA potato variety. This specific breed, developed by the International Potato Centre, was developed through traditional crossbreeding techniques and then trialled in different climates to ensure it tolerated heat and drought. UNICA can be grown on both lowlands and highlands, reaches maturity early (three months) and has the innate ability to resist water and heat stress. Its uniqueness also makes it resistant to several viral diseases and the late blight fungus which are common in Laikipia. “We chose the UNICA potato variety based on the local needs of the farmers, the environmental conditions and in answering to the project goals of building the resilience of potato farmers to climate change using climate-smart techniques. The results are quite impactful,” said Barrack Okoba, the FAO WEE-CSA project manager. Funded by the Korea International Cooperation Agency, the Women Economic Empowerment through Climate-Smart Agriculture project helped improve the value chain, of crops like potatoes, to help farmers secure their food and livelihood sources. ©FAO Trainings spring impactful results The WEE-CSA project provided women farmers in Laikipia with trainings on how to grow the UNICA potato variety, handle the post-harvest process, as well as find ways to sell their products to the local markets. Esther is a member of the Ngenia People with Disabilities Self Help Group. She, along with her group, was selected to partake in these training sessions where they learned propagation and production techniques for the UNICA potatoes. The project primarily aimed to reach people with disabilities who sometimes get overlooked for trainings but who are a crucial part of the farming community in Laikipia. When asked about her training, Esther responds, “We have been potato farmers over the years, but it is the first time we are doing it using apical cuttings which we were given through the WEE-CSA project. They are far better and give us potatoes that fetch better profits and leave us with a lot for our family consumption.” This is because an apical cutting uses tissue culture plants that yields high quality seeds. In addition, because of these trainings, Esther shares that she no longer uses chemicals to fight the potato late blight disease, as she had with traditional potato varieties, because UNICA is naturally resistant to it. Another aspect of the project included training on financial literacy and as a result, Esther’s group have so far been able to grow their savings to KSH 500 000 (USD 4 000) through their village saving and lending scheme - an informal banking system for farming businesses. With significant increase in their harvest, a business opportunity also arose in the forms of crisps, bajia (fritter) and chips. Esther’s group packages these potato snacks and distribute them through the local markets for additional income. Going forward, they wish to expand their products to other towns and cities. At the closure field exhibition, the WEE-CSA project also connected Esther’s group with a local company that specializes in the processing of potatoes and works in collaboration with the Potato Council of Kenya. By promoting partnerships between women potato farmers and local potato businesses, they can increasingly work together to meet the demands in other local markets, ensuring the livelihoods of women farmers and the continuation of sustainable potato production.

      "article_text": "Christabel Kwasi, a young Ghanian farmer and mother, learned that with better farming practices, she and her family can rely on fonio all year-round. ©FAO/Fanjan Combrink Three young siblings from a small town in northeastern Ghana wake up one morning delighted by the fonio porridge that awaits them that day. As the children enjoy their breakfast, Christabel Kwasi, the 29-year-old farmer and mother of three, is pleased to see the fruits of her labour in the smiles of her children. She is also quietly grateful that she had enough harvest to feed her family of five. Fonio, an ancient indigenous West African cereal, which has traditionally been cultivated by women in northern Ghana, is a staple food for Christabel and many families in the district of Chereponi. Fonio, once boiled, resembles couscous and can be consumed as such or made into a porridge. It can even be turned into flour for baking. It is a versatile crop that generations have relied on, for both food and livelihoods. “I realized that my family likes fonio, and they depend on fonio more than any other food crop,” says Christabel. “Our grandparents were telling us, [in] our forefather's time there was a lot of hunger. So fonio is the type [where] if you don't even have money to buy chemicals [fertilisers], you can still farm it, feed on it.” As she regales the festivities that surround the harvest and consumption of this nutritious millet , Christabel expresses her eagerness to teach people across Ghana how they can also grow fonio and prepare dishes with it. With fonio, “I will not teach people to have food for one day. But I will teach them to have food always,” she says. Together with FAO and Ghana's Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Chef Fatmata Binta, an advocate of fonio as a nutritious food and a livelihood opportunity for women farmers, is aiming to boost fonio production and consumption in Chereponi and across the country. ©FAO/Fanjan Combrink Fonio for all year-round It wasn’t until a year ago that Christabel learned she could grow fonio during the dry season as well. Previously, she thought she had to wait for periods of rainfall and solely rely on the arduous traditional methods of cultivation, which often left her family with little to no harvest during the dry season. In Ghana, the limited resources for rural farmers and the manual methods of post-harvest handling and processing, mostly undertaken by women, is an exhaustive process impacting their yields. However, a project recently implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), in collaboration with Chef Fatmata Binta , renowned in the culinary world for bringing African gastronomy to the global scene, has given Christabel and other farmers the knowledge that they can rely on this crop year-round. Together with the Ghana’s Ministry of Food and Agriculture, the project aims to support women fonio producers in Ghana to enhance their cultivation skills and boost productivity and income. “The good collaboration between FAO, Chef Binta, and Ghana’s Ministry of Food and Agriculture has shown how fonio is an effective resilience-building measure particularly for communities affected by prolonged dry spells, such as we’re seeing now in northern Ghana. By supporting better production of fonio, communities can access a sustainable, climate-resilient crop that can improve food security and provide new livelihood opportunities,” said Priya Gujadhur, the FAO Representative ad interim in Ghana. The project is a further extension of FAO and Chef Binta’s work in advocating for the potential of fonio as a nutritious ingredient and a livelihood opportunity for women farmers. “We talk about hunger; we talk about climate change. And I see fonio as a solution, especially in Africa,” Chef Binta says. “The fact that you are able to grow something that is so low maintenance; they will be able to feed their families, put their kids through school and have enough money to support themselves,” she added. To minimize the labour-intensive process of processing fonio, Chef Binta is providing processing machines, and with training on the use of the machine, women fonio producers will be able to process fonio with better quality and greater quantities. ©FAO/Fanjan Combrink Investing in women fonio farmers Through training sessions on better production and post-harvest techniques, women fonio producers learned to increase their yields and properly store their grains to prevent food loss. Specific sessions on planting methods, fertilisation and nutrient management were dedicated to helping the women grow more. “We have gotten to know that it's not only broadcasting [a method of farming where you scatter seeds over the soil] that you can farm your fonio. You can farm it in a line [planting in rows],” Christabel says, reflecting on what she learned. Planting in rows requires less seeds and the uniformity makes cultivating practices more effective. The traditional method of fonio processing, the biggest challenge for the women, requires they pound the grains by hand for threshing, winnowing and then also manually drying. To minimize this time-consuming and labour-intensive process, Chef Binta is providing processing machines, and with training on how to operate the machinery from an agronomist, women fonio producers will be able to process their fonio with better quality and greater quantities. Subsequently, the knowledge and skills the women learned about proper bagging, packing and control of pests will greatly improve storage practices and reduce food loss during this stage. This way, they can properly store their grains to consume or sell later in the year. Another objective of the project is to sensitize the public on fonio consumption and spread the benefits of fonio to communities beyond Chereponi. Chef Binta, with her expertise on fonio, is building trust and showcasing this potential. She is currently working with the women fonio producers to build a cooperative where they can have the space to collaborate and celebrate its production. By unlocking the potential of this grain and investing in the women who produce them, families can remain food secure and improve their livelihoods for generations. The Right to Food is a universal human right. This year, we are advocating for that and more. The foods that feed us need to take into account diversity, nutrition, affordability, accessibility as well as safety and sustainability. Over 2.8 billion people are still unable to afford a healthy diet. As we move toward World Food Day on October 16, FAO is emphasizing that the right to the foods, which meet all of these pillars, is crucial for a better life and a better future for all. Learn more"

      "article_text": "©UN Women / Srijana Battha Laruwati Kamat, a rural woman farmer from Siraha district in eastern Nepal, has always known the value of fresh food. For generations, her family followed seasonal patterns to cultivate vegetables, believing certain months were the only viable time to grow. However, her approach to farming began to change through her involvement in the Joint Programme on Rural Women’s Economic Empowerment (JP RWEE), a global initiative that aims to empower rural women. The JP RWEE program provided Laruwati with high-quality seeds and introduced her to modern agricultural techniques, for year-round cultivation. She also learned the greenhouse technique for growing saplings from her son, who had acquired this knowledge through his work with an agriculture project. This support allowed her to expand her farming practices beyond traditional seasonal constraints. Now, Laruwati produces vegetables like cauliflower and leafy greens every season. Her farm is abundant with fresh, nutritious vegetables throughout the year. \"In the past, we didn’t have access to such seeds, which limited both our family’s food supply and income. Our yield has increased since the intervention,” she says. “Now we have more produce to eat and sell.” This transition from traditional farming to a more innovative, sustainable approach has increased Laruwati’s income and transformed her into a key contributor to her community’s food security and nutrition. Thanks to the JP RWEE programme, her knowledge of sustainable agriculture has grown further empowering her entrepreneurial journey. Figure 2: Laruwati and Saraswati of Mithila Farmers' Group working in their paddy field. Photo Credit: UN Women/Srijana Bhatta Jointly implemented by the FAO, IFAD, WFP and UN Women (as a lead agency), the JP RWEE programme seeks to promote sustainable agriculture practices among rural women, support healthy food production and increase their incomes. It further strengthens their collective voice, leadership and participation in institutions that can help their small businesses and communities thrive. In Nepal, the large-scale out-migration of men from the villages has significantly increased women’s work, both at home and on the farm. Women now face greater challenges in securing their households’ food security and livelihoods. With around 80% of women engaged in agriculture, primarily as subsistence farmers, the programme’s second phase is focused on equipping rural women with the skills and machinery needed for sustainable agricultural practices. The support provided through the programme not only helps them transition into mid-level farmers by increasing production and productivity but also reduces their workload, drudgery, and time poverty. The programme also emphasizes economic and social empowerment to help these women unlock their full potential and improve their overall well-being.

Photo credit: UN/Women/Srijana Battha In March 2024, the JP RWEE programme facilitated a contract between Laruwati's farmer group and the local school, aligning with the government’s mid-day meal programme for public schools. This initiative, part of JP RWEE Nepal’s Home-Grown School Feeding approach, successfully linked 1,091 women farmers with community schools in Siraha and Saptari districts. Benefitting from this arrangement, Laruwati and her fellow farmers now provide fresh produce daily to Shree Doma Higher Secondary School, right in their neighborhood. “Our vegetables go directly to the children,” Laruwati explains. “We know they are eating fresh food free from harmful chemicals.” The children receive nutritious meals through this programme, greatly benefiting their health and well-being. Figure 4: Vegetables being prepared for the mid-day meal for school children. Figure 5: Children enjoying their home-grown meals during their mid-day break. Empowering Women Through Food The Home-Grown School Feeding initiative is not only about feeding schoolchildren; it is also about empowering women like Laruwati. By connecting local women farmers with schools, the initiative ensures a consistent market for their produce, providing financial stability and enhancing their economic independence. In the Madhesi community, women and girls often face more restrictions compared to other parts of Nepal, limiting their opportunities to engage in economic activities. The programme's consistent support has enabled Madhesi women like Laruwati to step out of their homes, sell their produce, and negotiate with schools and customers. This reflects a growing sense of empowerment. Laruwati’s increased income has inspired her to invest her time and efforts in better farming practices, further increasing her yield. “During a recent JP RWEE training, we learned to make ‘jholmol,’ a botanical pesticide that helps our plants grow healthier and stronger. It’s good for the soil, and it’s better for the people who eat our vegetables,” she says. These sustainable practices increase her productivity and contribute to healthier food for her community. Figure 6: Nirmala Chaudhary, Chairperson of the Mithila Farmers' Group, applying 'jholmol,' a biopesticide, to her plants. Nourishing Generations For Laruwati, the benefits of her farming extend beyond financial gains. Her ability to provide healthy, home-grown food to her community's children is deeply fulfilling. Additionally, her increased earnings have allowed her to support her grandchildren’s education, sending money for school fees and supplies and positioned her as a key decision-maker within her household. “Years ago, I struggled to even imagine providing this level of education for my children,” she reflects. “Now, I am financially able to contribute to my grandchildren’s education.” Looking Ahead Although a full-time farmer, Laruwati has passions beyond the fields. She loves traveling and has visited several religious destinations in India, including Vaishno Devi, Haridwar and Vrindavan, with some trips lasting up to 15 days. “I love my family and enjoy being with them,” she says. “But whenever I travel, I feel like I never want to come back and wish the journey would never end.” With her newfound financial stability, she hopes to embark on more travel adventures in the days to come. Laruwati’s journey from subsistence farming to becoming a critical player in her community’s food system is a powerful example of how access to resources, training, and market opportunities, along with strengthened leadership, voice and agency, can empower women farmers. With a passion for farming and a growing entrepreneurial spirit, Laruwati is nourishing her community and family, all while cultivating a legacy of empowerment and sustainability through the simple yet profound act of growing food."

      "article_text": "Women cleaning fresh Freekeh, Dura Women Cooperative, Dura, West Bank, 2024. © FAO/Azzam Saleh In the sun-drenched hills of Palestine, in towns like Qabalan, Dura and Tufah, a quiet transformation is unfolding despite challenges such as conflict, transportation delays, soaring costs, and climate change, with Palestinians—especially women in farming and herding communities—forging a new path of resilience and empowerment. Palestine relies heavily on imports for essential goods like food, cereals, and fertilizers. The impact of COVID-19 pandemic that is still being felt in addition to the conflict in Ukraine intensified this dependency, leading to unpredictable price fluctuations and supply chain disruptions. In addition, Palestinians in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, are severely affected by recent Israeli military operations, are suffering from a worsening humanitarian crisis, increasing food insecurity, socioeconomic instability, and vulnerability. However, in towns throughout the West Bank, women are coming together to navigate the challenges posed by the Israeli occupation, internal political divisions, recurrent shocks, and macroeconomic imbalances. Women are finding empowerment through agriculture, utilizing sustainable practices and cooperative efforts supported by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Qabalan’s breakthrough In Qabalan, a women's cooperative faced similar challenges, struggling with difficult access to markets and the lack of a clear strategic vision. “Competition for our [commercial] products was tough,\" Nadia, the cooperative’s Chair, says. FAO provided the Qabalan women’s cooperative with financial and technical assistance to enhance their agrifood processing businesses. This support included producing local alternatives to imported foods, such as freekeh and whole grain wheat flour, and offering technical training to improve their value-adding capabilities and market access. Through exploring the market, the cooperative identified key products and decided to focus on sambousek (samosa), taking advantage of the manufacturing experience of some members. Equipped with a modern “shock” freezing system provided by FAO, they shifted their focus from quantity to quality, transforming their initial struggles with diverse products and logistical hurdles into a dedicated effort to produce high-quality samosa. \"Shock freezing and processing units have ensured food safety and made certifications easier to obtain,\" said Amera, a cooperative member. With improved market access, their delectable samosa now reaches tables across the West Bank, including in large cities like Ramallah, Nablus, and Jenin. Qabalan woman cooperative’s recognized sambousek, Qabalan, West Bank, 2024. -- A selection of local bread produced by the Al Nahda Cooperative Association, Tafuh, West Bank, 2024. © FAO/Bayan Mujahed Dura’s women Like in Qabalan, 20 women in Dura, a small town in the south of the West Bank, formed a partnership in 2012, with FAO’s support to produce hand-rolled maftool, a Palestinian staple, similar in texture to couscous. From humble beginnings, this cooperative not only achieved certification but transformed into a thriving economic hub with a two-story headquarters, with a 2 million ILS annual budget. Their success extends beyond maftool to other traditional foods in the Palestinian diet, such as mulukhiyah, and grape-derived products like molasses and jams. Yet, their impact transcends economic gains. The cooperative has become a beacon of social empowerment, provided stable jobs, and fostered a powerful sense of community among the women. \"We love the cooperative more than our homes,\" jests cooperative member Ibtisam Nassar, while stirring a large pan of maftool. Challenges they have faced along the way, like family objections and land disputes have only strengthened their resolve, accelerating them to the heart of Palestinian markets with plans for enhanced production and exports. As the sole women's cooperative actively shaping community decisions in Dura, their initiative has not only uplifted its members but sparked a wave of interest among local women seeking economic independence and community engagement. Baking a better future Established in 2020, the Al Nahda Cooperative Association in Tafuh, composed of 22 women and one man from villages west of Hebron, has flourished since receiving bakery equipment from the FAO in 2021. Before FAO identified the Al Nadha Cooperative for support under a project funded by the Government of Canada, its women members worked individually using small-scale, traditional methods. After an FAO-Ministry of Agriculture needs assessment, it became clear they required essential bakery equipment to scale up production and improve the quality and variety of their products. Qabalan Women’s Cooperative member uses dough roller to produce the town's recognized sambousek. Qabalan, West Bank, 2024. © FAO/Ross Bryan Now a vibrant community enterprise in a town of 18 000, it produces a local variety of bread and sweets, generating monthly sales of 25 000 NIS with a profit margin of 25 percent. Tafuh’s women’s cooperative prides itself on the quality of its local breads like pita, shrak and taboon, and its sale on the mainstream Palestinian market. The next phase of their plan includes opening a new bakery in a nearby village to further expand their market reach and supply to surrounding areas. Bashera Ahmad Zreqat, a 49-year-old cooperative member with a family of nine, is enthusiastic to lead this new venture. “We are enthusiastic about this work and see it as a significant step, especially in the current situation. Working in the bakery has supported my family and positively impacted my personal growth” she says. Hana Ghareeb, the Cooperative’s 52-year-old chair, with a family of five, adds, “The bakery represents self-sufficiency for women, empowering us to achieve our unique aspirations and fostering self-reliance within the association.” Their journey underscores resilience, empowerment, and the transformative impact of collective efforts in agriculture and community building. Through the FAO’s \"Support Economic Growth through Optimized Agricultural Value Chains in the West Bank\" project, funded by the Government of Canada, these women are poised to achieve a Better life – it aims to enhance incomes and strengthen Palestinian land ownership. FAO's support for women under this project is one aspect of its broader assistance for people in the West Bank. In addition to the other interventions implemented under this project, through which Palestinian farmers affected by recurrent challenges and shocks receive support through technical assistance, conditional cash for intercropping with olive orchards, international promotion of Palestinian olive oil, and emergency distribution of drought-tolerant fodder seeds. These efforts aim to strengthen farmers' resilience and sustain agriculture-based livelihoods, including those of Bedouin communities.

      "article_text": "Augustina Tufuor (centre) started her company to produce healthy snacks but encountered obstacles in securing financing when she sought to expand her business. ©FAO/Natalija Gormalova Augustina Akosua Asor Tufuor’s entrepreneurial spark was ignited while she was a student at the University of Ghana Business School and enrolled in a course on business management. The same year, she met a group of rural farmers and saw the vast potential for local agricultural products, as well as the hurdles they faced. “I witnessed firsthand how these farmers, most of whom were small-scale and women, would leave heaps of produce, mainly plantains, cassava and sweet potatoes, simply because they did not have available buyers and the cost of transporting back to their villages was very high. That would leave them with massive losses,” describes Augustina. She also realized that the snacks that were available in the market were filled with artificial additives, preservatives and high levels of salt and sugar. And from this a new business idea was born. With her own savings and family support, she founded Tropical Snacks, which creates all-natural plantain chips from surplus local produce. Her goal was to bridge the gap between small farmers and consumers while providing healthier snack alternatives for the Ghanaian market and beyond. But she found it hard to expand operations. Access to finance, market information and adequate infrastructure posed significant barriers. Traditional financial institutions were reluctant to support a small, woman-led venture. “When we first approached bankers for a loan, we were asked to make a deposit of GHS 20 000 (approximately USD 1 200) even before getting the amount we requested. We also had to get a professional evaluator to evaluate our business, which was expensive. Then there was the high interest rate which was over 36 percent,” she explains. Her challenges are not uncommon. Women consistently face structural barriers that hinder their economic potential and impact their business operations in agrifood systems. For women in agrifood systems in sub-Saharan Africa—where they make up a large proportion of the workforce—the hurdles are particularly steep, from lack of access to land, credit and technology to the gendered social norms that often undervalue their work. According to a study by the International Trade Centre (ITC), over 70 percent of women-led businesses in Africa have insufficient access to financial services, while many also operate in the informal sector where they lack legal protections and access to training and market information. Asma Begum Mirza, a 61-year-old Nigerian agripreneur, had a similar difficulty in accessing loans. In response to skyrocketing prices, Asma decided to grow rice in 2015 to help ordinary citizens access affordable food. However, worsening security conditions in northern Nigeria soon disrupted her business. “After about two years of successfully growing rice, it started becoming increasingly difficult and dangerous to go to the farm because of security problems,” she says. She was eventually forced to relocate, leaving her rice farm behind and starting a new farm near Abuja. However, in doing so, she lost most of her customers. Like Augustina, Asma faced significant barriers in securing loans as she tried to rebuild her business in a new location. High-interest rates and collateral requirements made it almost impossible to buy appropriate machines for commercial production, and her growth remained stifled. Over 70 percent of women-led businesses, like Augustina’s and Asma’s, in Africa have insufficient access to financial services, and many operate in the informal sector where they lack legal protections. Left/top: ©FAO/ Natalija Gormalova. Right/bottom: ©FAO/ Misper Apawu Skills and opportunities In 2021, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) along with the ITC launched a targeted programme called Empowering Women and Boosting Livelihoods through Agricultural Trade (EWAT). Spanning six countries, EWAT promotes women’s participation in the context of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). The programme’s objective is to increase women’s competitiveness in trade through strengthened knowledge, skills and access to finance, capitalizing on the new prospects for regional trade created by the AfCFTA agreement. EWAT equips women with the skills and resources needed to engage in national and cross border trade by offering training in product development, sales and marketing, as well as in finance management, bookkeeping and business plan development. In 2023, both Augustina and Asma participated in Business and Investment Readiness Bootcamps offered by the project in their countries. \"We learned how crucial record keeping in business is when it comes to seeking funds. We now record our sales… and now I can say that we are in a better position to be able to get investors for our business,” Augustina says. Asma Begum Mirza was one of the women agripreneurs who benefitted from the EWAT programme’s one-on-one support and advice in navigating business management and expansion. ©FAO/ Misper Apawu Bridging the gap Within the EWAT programme, FAO further works with financial institutions to develop products and services tailored to women in agribusiness. This is particularly important in the agriculture sector where many women entrepreneurs rely on their personal savings or informal networks for funding. “Most women rely on their own financing to go into business… so the programme tries to address this by bringing financial service providers like commercial banks together with women agripreneurs, creating an opportunity for dialogue,” said Bethel Terefe, Senior Gender Expert in the FAO Regional Office for Africa. Francesca Distefano, EWAT Programme Coordinator, elaborates, “In 2024, we launched a mentorship programme, which provides EWAT beneficiaries with one-on-one dedicated support and advice to navigate business management and expansion… In Ghana and Nigeria, EWAT is also in the process of disbursing small grants to selected women, including to Asma and Augustina, to support them to cover standards certification and formalization of their products.” By the end of the year, EWAT will deliver finance training and organise meetings with financial institutions to help women agripreneurs present their businesses and explore investment opportunities. The goal is to ensure that, as Africa’s trade potential increases through the AfCFTA, women also benefit from new opportunities. Learn more"

      "article_text": "Farming has been a way of life for Jacqueline Hakizimana, but the techniques that were passed down to her weren’t producing enough to feed her family. ©FAO/Joseph Nsabiyabandi Amidst the rolling hills of Burundi’s Gitega Province, Jacqueline Hakizimana, 42, looks out over the land she once struggled against. Here, where the earth long resisted her, where seeds once vanished into dust, the land is green with rows of maize and beans. The crops rise neatly from the soil. For Jacqueline, farming has been a way of life for over 30 years, having inherited the profession from her family, who farmed the nearby Kiremera Hill. But despite her experience, her results were far from ideal. She had only poor-quality seeds and little understanding of how to fertilize the soil effectively. \"I remember sowing 100 kilograms of beans over two hectares and harvesting just 90 kilograms,\" she says, noting that her harvest was less than what she planted. Her rudimentary farming techniques were passed down from her parents or learned from neighbors, and year after year, the yields were disappointing. She grew beans, maize, cassava, sweet potatoes and pigeon peas, but the output was barely enough to feed her family – husband and four children. \"We would eat what little we harvested, and I had to buy the rest from the market,\" she recalls. \"I thought my children would have to fend for themselves to survive,\" she says, reflecting on how their situation once seemed. It was during this period that Jacqueline heard about Farmer Field Schools (FFS) being implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), together with Burundi’s Ministry of Environment, Agriculture and Livestock and local NGOs. FFS are a practical, hands-on programme where farmers learn improved techniques through field demonstrations. \"I learned about the FFS through a training session led by an agronomist in our area,\" she explains. Although starting new ventures can feel risky, Jacqueline says, she was not worried. \"I felt confident because I was with other women from my community,\" she says. The FFS introduced Jacqueline to several innovations that helped revolutionize her farming. The biggest of these changes was turning FFS groups into cooperatives, with a focus on connecting farmers to markets. Now part of a cooperative, she wasn’t just learning better techniques—she was becoming part of a larger network that would help her access markets, sell her products and boost her income. The FAO FFS introduced Jacqueline to several innovations that helped revolutionize her farming. The biggest of these was turning FFS groups into cooperatives, a network that would help her access markets, sell her products and boost her income. ©FAO/Joseph Nsabiyabandi In the first days of FFS, Jacqueline received practical training in crop management and soil conservation. She learned to plant in rows, use better-quality seeds and manage her soil with contour lines and agroforestry practices that reduced erosion. \"Before, I used huge amounts of seeds and harvested very little,\" she recalls. \"Now I sow a minimal amount, and the harvest is larger, even though I cultivate the same land.\" The turning point came when she applied her newfound knowledge. \"I planted 70 kilograms of maize on two hectares and harvested 1 600 kilograms of maize grains,\" she says. This success enabled her to buy a 0.5-hectare plot of land. With the money raised from selling the plants produced by the cooperative, she and her family purchased two improved-breed cows, five goats and six rabbits, which further contributed to their farm’s sustainability by providing organic manure. \"Now, I can afford things I never dreamed of, like buying my own land,\" Jacqueline beams. Her leadership has also flourished. Jacqueline is now president of the Turwanyubukene Cooperative, which translates to “Overcoming Poverty Together.” Today, she trains other members of the cooperative in the agricultural techniques she has mastered, and her influence is felt throughout her community. Her cooperative cultivates 12 hectares of diversified crops and has 400 kilograms of maize in stock, with savings in the bank. Their next project is to build a warehouse to store harvested crops and install a mill to add value to their maize production. \"Our goal now is to collect production from surrounding households, store it and process it for market,\" she says. This shift from subsistence farming to market-oriented agriculture is the result of FAO’s broader strategy to connect small-scale farmers to local and national markets. For Jacqueline, the project was about seeing greater opportunities through collective action. \"By working with other farmers, we could share experiences, learn from demonstration plots and sell our products together at market,\" she explains. In Burundi, women have been key to the success of the cooperative model. Women make up 78.3 percent of Farmer Field School members and cooperatives in the country, and they hold 73 percent of decision-making roles within committees focused on sustainable value chains. Their leadership has helped restore degraded lands, introduce crop rotation and organic farming and improve household nutrition. Moreover, women’s earnings have increased household incomes by an average of 20 percent. \"Women have been the driving force behind many of these changes,\" says Dieudonne Kameca, an FAO value chain expert from Burundi. FAO is helping farmers move from subsistence to market-oriented agriculture by promoting cooperatives and connecting them to local and national markets. ©FAO/Joseph Nsabiyabandi Despite the impressive gains, challenges remain. Access to credit, delays in obtaining equipment and the volatility of agricultural markets continue to hinder progress. FAO is conducting market studies, improving price information sharing and promoting agricultural entrepreneurship to tackle these issues. \"With the right resources and backing, transformation is not only possible—it’s inevitable,” says Vincent Martin, Director of FAO’s Office of Innovation. “Even in the most challenging environments, farmers can overcome adversity and turn hard work into success, paving the way for a brighter future for their families and communities.\" In Jacqueline’s case, she has transformed her farm into a thriving business. \"I used to think my children would have to struggle like I did,\" she says. \"Now, I know they have a better future ahead.\" FAO’s efforts in Burundi are not just about increasing agricultural production, they are about building resilient communities capable of facing economic and environmental challenges. The farmers of Gitega Province are now leaders in a movement to revitalize agriculture in Burundi. With the right support, transformation is always possible. Learn more"

Unlike most of the world, this Bhutanese mother found a livelihood solution in hydroponics farming, which involves growing plants in a special nutrient-rich water instead of using soil. What began as a simple interest soon blossomed into a profound passion. She attended online trainings and saw that this innovative technique was also full of promise for addressing the challenges of food security and land fragmentation in her landlocked Himalayan homeland. Hydroponics uses less water and is more productive than soil-based agriculture and can be carried out all year round. Though hydroponics can be expensive and difficult to install, all it requires at its most basic level is the plants, water, a container and a source of light. To save on the cost of importing hydroponics systems, she learned extensively from international experts and customised their approaches for Bhutanese farmers. Using her previous experience as a contractor, undertaking everything from plumbing to electrical jobs, Kinley, who also currently runs a hardware shop, leveraged her skills and self-taught know-how to build a hydroponics system using the deep flow technique, which catches and recycles water using pipes. The system is low-cost, efficient and made using readily available materials. It’s also easy to maintain, making it accessible and practical for small-scale farmers in Bhutan’s rugged terrain. Kinley started Bhutan Hydroponics in a small-scale greenhouse in the Changzamtok area of the capital, Thimphu, back in 2020. In early 2024, Kinley was one of the 30 recipients of funding support from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) as part of its Peri-urban and Urban Farming project in Bhutan, implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock. The project helped her with land development, equipment and materials for the farm, as well as seeds on a cost-sharing basis, and technical support with installing the greenhouses, garden structures, irrigation systems and digital equipment she needed for the venture. Her vision is steadily taking shape with the establishment of three spacious greenhouses. \"The main benefit of hydroponics is that it helps plants and vegetables grow faster than traditional soil farming, and it takes up less space,\" Kinley explains. \"In a greenhouse, we can control everything to make sure the plants grow well.” Kinley has been steadily expanding her greenhouses and adding to the varieties of lettuce she produces for a growing market. ©FAO/Choki Wangmo Kinley is keen to share her knowledge to help communities in Bhutan become more independent. \"The pandemic showed us how important self-sufficiency is.\" She’s been a passionate advocate for increasing the use of hydroponics in the country, offering her expertise in setting up systems and selling her adapted hydroponics system at a cost that’s highly favourable compared with imported equipment. About one-third of Bhutan’s population faces food insecurity. With shrinking, fragmented land holdings and many working-age adults moving from rural to urban areas, labor-intensive agriculture is becoming increasingly challenging. The pandemic also showed the reliance of urban areas on food imported from abroad or from rural areas. In this, Bhutan’s Department of Agriculture has been pushing ahead with its strategy to promote urban farming. Kinley also advocates for self-sufficiency and safe food in urban areas, like the capital in which she lives. \"In urban areas where food security is a pressing issue, I am dedicated to making freshly harvested, nutritious food accessible to everyone. Amidst busy lifestyles and the challenge of accessing quality food, we aim to reduce food waste and promote healthier eating habits,” says Kinley. Kinley’s innovative methods, tailored to the available materials in Bhutan, are changing the future of food in the landlocked Himalayan country. ©FAO/Choki Wangmo Bhutan's economy relies heavily on agriculture, livestock and forests; this sector supports about 57 percent of the population. Even though the agriculture sector is growing in absolute terms, the share of the national Gross Domestic Product has been steadily decreasing due to rapid growth in other economic sectors. On top of that, agricultural productivity is being undermined by an array of factors including urbanization and rapid development, crop damage by wild animals, land fragmentation, pests and diseases, rising temperatures and a shortage of agricultural inputs. As a result, Bhutan's goals of food security and self-sufficiency are becoming harder to achieve. FAO’s project is addressing these issues by helping to move crop production closer to consumers and meeting growing demand in urban areas while showcasing new technologies for transforming agrifood systems, as well as creating more jobs and income opportunities especially for women and young people. Now, Kinley employs nine people, mostly single mothers and youth. Her current focus is on growing lettuce, which her team has harvested three times in five months and supplied to chain of hotels in the country. She currently grows two lettuce varieties and plans to cultivate three more types and recruit more staff in the future as her business continues to grow. \"Despite the challenges, I promote technology to inspire young people and women in agriculture because it's simple,\" Kinley says, adding that technology makes agriculture more appealing because it is less physically arduous and cleaner than conventional farming. Since she expanded her business early this year, she has been selling lettuce and salads in the capital and nearby towns. She says that if she can further expand the business, she would be able to meet the rapidly growing market demand. With her initiative full of innovative promise, Kinley is making an important contribution to the future of food, inspiring others and forging a new agricultural development model for Bhutan.

      "article_text": "With advice from FAO, a group of women in Betano, Timor-Leste started applying conservation agriculture techniques to their land with great success. ©FAO/ Blue milk studio In the small village of Betano, nestled in the lush landscapes of central Timor-Leste, a simple dispute over a humble legume has caused a quiet revolution to take root. It all started in 2019, when the women in the village became interested in piloting climate-smart agriculture techniques, and in particular conservation agriculture , which were being promoted in the area by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Following FAO’s advice, the women wanted to try mulching the fields with \"lehe,\" also known as green velvet beans, a type of local vine known to replenish soil nutrients. The men were skeptical, but the women understood the importance of enriching the soil. With financial support from the European Union, FAO assisted the women in setting up their own farmers’ group, which they named Fehama (meaning \"Women Loving Each Other\" in the local Tetum language). FAO also provided them with hand-held tractors, trailers, storage silos and other farming tools. Together with other farmers’ groups, they began to grow corn, leafy vegetables, papaya, cassava and bananas in their newly mulched land. Their goal was to produce enough to both feed family members and improve livelihoods. “We realized that by following FAO guidance, our productivity could progress further,” said Prisca da Costa, a founding member of Fehama . With the women now firmly on the path of climate-smart agriculture, FAO, with financial support from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), provided further assistance to Fehama by way of technical support and training on conservation agriculture techniques. These included important methods such as applying minimum soil disturbance (meaning no tillage) and diversifying plant species, with crops such as mung beans, in addition to maintaining permanent soil cover. Together, the women of Fehama embarked on a journey that would see their fields filled with a variety of crops, adding vibrant greens to their harvest. And so, a simple seed of contention sprouted into abundant and diversified farms, along with a flourishing women's farming collective. With financial support from the European Union, FAO assisted the women in setting up farmers’ groups and provided them with hand-held tractors, trailers and other farming tools. ©FAO/ Blue milk studio Homegrown school feeding: a win-win With the new harvests exceeding their expectations, a new challenge arose: Where to place their products? “In the beginning, when we started conservation agriculture with the FAO team, we did not have much confidence that we would be able to sell the products on the market,” recalls Joaquina Branco, from the cooperative Hakmoton , which also benefited from FAO support. At the time, local farmers relied on selling their products at the central municipal market, where oversupply drove prices down. Instead, FAO helped Fehama and other farmers groups find alternative ways to sell the products. One obvious candidate was the government’s Merenda Eskolar , a national social protection programme that provides free meals to children in elementary school. FAO connected the farmers’ groups to Merenda Eskolar to provide them with stable customers while supplying the children with nutritious food. In Timor-Leste, 75 percent of the population does not have enough food, and almost half of its children under five years old are stunted, making the Merenda Eskolar programme a vital component of the government’s efforts to improve food security and nutrition, heighten social protection for children and support the economic inclusion of farmers. FAO, in partnership with the local organization Hamutuk Ita Ajuda Malu Health and the local government, facilitated the stipulation of contracts between farmers and small enterprises that manage the school feeding programme in Manufahi municipality. FAO also advised on appropriate diets rich in protein, vitamins and minerals, as well as more efficient cooking methods. “The Merenda Eskolar programme has changed our way of producing,” Joaquina says. “Previously, we produced more food crops rich in carbohydrates. Now, we focus on horticulture, which brings more nutritional benefits and has more value than other food crops because it has a daily market demand.” This connection meant a stable source of nutrition for the school children and a regular income for the women’s group. “We store the products here. The programme comes to buy them and takes them to the schools. They pay us and we use the earnings to support our children with their school needs. We use the rest of the money to buy food and seeds to replant,” Prisca says. In all, FAO and its partners also trained over 70 food preparers, teachers and parents on balanced and nutritious meals for children, hygiene and food safety. Finally, to improve school kitchen facilities, FAO delivered kitchen utensils, steel trays for serving food, silos for storing cereals, water filters, refrigerators, crates, boxes for food storage and stainless-steel tables for food processing. FAO connected the farmers’ groups to Merenda Eskolar a programme that provides free meals to elementary school students. This provided the women with stable customers while supplying the children with nutritious food. ©FAO/ Blue milk studio Empowerment and community The project has not only helped provide income and nutritious food for the women but has also fostered a sense of self-reliance and empowerment. No longer are the women of Fehama trying to convince men how to grow their crops. They have proof of their success and the backing knowledge provided by FAO. At the same time, the nutritious food provided to the schools has helped ensure that the village children are well-nourished and better able to learn. This creates a ripple effect, contributing to a healthier and better educated community. In 2023 alone, the programme reached 18 schools in Manufahi municipality, providing 10 of these with a direct food supply for over 2 400 students. FAO plans to further strengthen Merenda Eskolar and replicate it in other parts of the country. The Right to Food is a universal human right. This year, we are advocating for that and more. The foods that feed us need to take into account diversity, nutrition, affordability, accessibility as well as safety and sustainability. Over 2.8 billion people are still unable to afford a healthy diet. As we move toward World Food Day on October 16, FAO is emphasizing that the right to the foods, which meet all of these pillars, is crucial for a better life and a better future for all. Learn more"

      "article_text": "In northwestern Bangladesh, farmers often struggle to access markets to sell their produce, to the extent that they often cannot even afford to repay the lease on the land. ©FAO/Saikat Mojumder Salma Akter Aduri’s family were hoping that growing cash crops would be the answer. “We were growing a special type of potato called the ‘sunshine potato’, which can grow fast with good yields,” Salma recalls. “But the amount we had to sell was so small, we just couldn’t sell them at a profitable price.” Salma and her family are potato farmers from Rangpur in northwestern Bangladesh. This region is prone to destructive monsoon floods and seasonal drought, and farmers here are increasingly reliant on cultivating cash crops to withstand these frequent weather-related shocks. But even this wasn’t working. “Many of our neighbors were in the same boat. They leased land to grow these potatoes but couldn’t even make enough to pay back the lease.” The situation was becoming dire. It looked like they would be forced to either give up their land or to take high interest loans from moneylenders. Salma was worried about her family’s farming future and even wanted to leave agriculture altogether. A breakthrough When Salma’s family joined the Birahim Farmer’s Cooperative, it proved a turning point. The producers’ organization received crucial support through the Missing Middle Initiative, implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and funded by the Global Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP). In collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture and the Sara Bangla Krishak Society (SBKS) – a national federation of farmers’ organizations in Bangladesh including Birahim – this FAO initiative worked with farmers to expand their access to finance, markets, technology and information. “This support was vital,” Salma states. “We realized the importance of bulk selling our produce together with other farmers, so we could access markets offering higher prices. We finally got access to finance at competitive rates. And with these benefits, Birahim membership grew!” In 2018, Salma was fresh out of high school and awaiting university admission. She stepped in to help with Birahim’s record-keeping. With FAO support, Birahim then made a breakthrough by connecting with the Bangladesh Potato Exporters Association. “Seeing our potatoes being exported was a dream come true for me and my family,” Salma exclaims. “It made me want to support other communities to export as well.” As potato farmers, Salma’s family joined the Birahim Farmer’s Cooperative, which received crucial support in expanding their access to finance, markets, technology and information. This support was part of the Missing Middle Initiative, implemented by FAO in collaboration with the Ministry of Agriculture and the Sara Bangla Krishak Society, and funded by GAFSP. ©FAO/Saikat Mojumder Innovation amidst adversity The COVID-19 pandemic prompted Birahim to innovate. With support from SBKS and FAO, Birahim and other producer organizations established a Virtual Call Centre (VCC) to keep their community’s farming business operational. The VCC became a critical hub, providing agricultural advice, market information and financial services to farmers remotely. Salma, recognized for her dedication, was appointed as a VCC Operator in 2020. “My family was resistant due to our conservative background, but the president of the producer organization convinced them. After the training, I was taken more seriously,” Salma explains. Crucially, she was also paving the way for more women in her community and inspiring other young people. “Now they are asking me about opportunities to get involved in agriculture. It’s exciting,” she says enthusiastically. Rising to become a leader Salma’s skills and expertise as a VCC operator led to her appointment as an accountant for Birahim. She also became a farmer business facilitator, monitoring the management, finances and business plans of other producer organizations. Initially, she experienced some teasing and skepticism. She also faced challenges working with older male leaders in other communities. But her strategic approach helped overcome resistance. “Over time, they came to respect my own knowledge and experience!” Meanwhile, FAO and SBKS, with further funding from GAFSP, launched the ACCESS project, which works with producer organizations in climate-affected areas to access local value chains. ACCESS builds on the successes of the Missing Middle Initiative – in which 10 000 smallholders saw an average 35 percent increase in annual incomes. With opportunities from ACCESS, Salma has honed her skills and become an accountant for SBKS’s Secretariat. Birahim is also successfully exporting potatoes and has started a vegetable seed business. ©FAO/Saikat Mojumder. Financial stability and a vision for the future Now, the Birahim cooperative continues to successfully export potatoes and has started a vegetable seed business. “We received help to access credit and market our seeds, and we are working with reputable partners across Bangladesh, producing quality vegetable seeds,” Salma says with pride. Banks are also getting involved in developing modern technologies for vegetable seed production. The Dutch-Bangla Bank is funding SBKS and the Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute, enabling Birahim farmers to produce five tons of vegetable seeds annually. “It’s been a significant journey for our community, from struggling to repay loans to achieving financial stability,” Salma reflects. Salma has recently joined SBKS’s Secretariat as an accountant. She has risen to become a community leader in agricultural innovation and empowerment. “I want to help other communities access export markets, so they can benefit from financial stability and higher incomes,” she declares. “I want to see more women empowered under ACCESS and for our network of smallholder farmers, SBKS, grow to national recognition.” Salma’s story is part of a series of FAO feature stories to mark the 60th anniversary of the FAO Investment Centre, highlighting decades of partnerships, initiatives and investments that have shaped agrifood systems.

      "article_text": "Nirosha Dilmini has never had such a lucrative year as 2023. She attributes this to the modern practices that she learned through the Good Agricultural Practices programme, implemented by FAO with funding from the UN Sri Lanka SDG Fund. ©FAO Nirosha Dilmini has been harvesting eggplants since the crack of dawn on her small plot of land in the village of Tanamalvila in southeastern Sri Lanka’s Monaragala district. She’s been putting her efforts into farming here for six years now. But never has she had such a lucrative year as 2023 in terms of produce and profits. “The quarter acre of our land yielded produce equivalent to that of one acre,” she says with pride as she takes a break, fanning herself under the shade of a tree and getting ready to pick the rest of the crop. She attributes this transformation to the Good Agricultural Practices (GAP) programme implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) with funding from the United Nations Sri Lanka Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Fund. Nirosha is one of 645 Sri Lankan farmers across three districts who were trained under the programme and provided with equipment and technical packages to modernize their farming practices and increase their yields and profits. Through an FAO- facilitated Farmer Field School, farmers were trained in GAP principles including environmental sustainability, food safety and quality, economic viability and social acceptability. ©FAO The GAP programme started as a response to the pressing food security challenges amidst Sri Lanka's economic crisis, supporting vegetable farmers to commercialize their products. Nirosha and her fellow farmers each received an agriculture kit containing essential items such as a drip irrigation system, plastic mulch and insect-proof netting. The kit aims to reduce the cost of cultivation and help make more efficient use of crucial resources such as fertilizers, weed killers, pesticides and water. The farmers were also trained in GAP principles including environmental sustainability, food safety and quality, economic viability and social acceptability through a Farmer Field School (FFS) facilitated by FAO. This immersive training not only equipped them with the necessary knowledge for national GAP certification but also enabled them to implement the modern agricultural techniques, such as drip irrigation systems, insect netting and plastic mulching, effectively. She elaborates, “Previously, it took an entire day to fertilize our land. Now, a single 20-liter fertilizer bucket covers over 500 crops, saving us time, effort and money. The mulch also curtails weed growth, further lightening our workload.\" Also, Nirosha says that while the time between the two annual monsoon cultivation seasons, from the end of May to August, used to see her struggling to make ends meet, the modern techniques she learned have allowed her to cultivate the land throughout 2023, turning a profit even during the off-season. “We can now cover vast areas with minimal water, maximizing productivity even in challenging weather conditions.\" The GAP programme has currently certified over 115 farmers and trained 95 extension officers in Farmer Field Schools, leading to the establishment of a further 28 schools. ©FAO For the past 11 months post-GAP training, Nirosha’s primary crop has been eggplants with a few patches of okra and green beans. As the annual cycle nears its end, she prepares to harvest the last of her eggplants and embark on a new venture with watermelon cultivation. “I plan to clear the ground and start an interim watermelon crop with the existing equipment,\" she concludes optimistically. “With continued support from FAO, the livelihoods of farmers like us can exponentially improve.\" Under the GAP programme, so far 95 extension officers have been trained in Farmer Field Schools, leading to the establishment of 28 such schools. GAP has also significantly increased the incomes of farmers. At the end of the project indicates, 32 percent of the farmers had increased their income by a minimum of approximately USD 65 (LKR 20 000) per 0.25 acre farmland per month. The programme has currently certified over 115 farmers as well. Apart from the new learnings and equipment provided, another very important gain was the connections established with leading supermarket chains, where the farmers could sell their bumper crops in bulk and make larger profits. Additionally, innovative extension approaches using social media platforms along with exposure visits to existing GAP farms, facilitate avenues for knowledge sharing and skill development among farmers. Through FAO's support and the dedication of extension officers and fellow farmers, Nirosha has not only seen personal success but also has hope for agricultural sustainability and prosperity in Sri Lanka.

      "article_text": "The impacts of climate change in Cabo Verde are evident with drought and pests hurting the productivity and incomes of the country’s farmers, like Elisabeth Da Conceiçao. ©FAO/Giuseppe Carotenuto The beans pop out of their sheathing as Elisabeth Da Conceiçao lays them out to dry. It’s the end of the harvesting season. This year there was enough rain that she could keep some of the beans, sweet potatoes and corn for her family’s consumption, but also sell some. It all depends on the rain. Though the climate in Rui Vaz in the high hills of Cabo Verde’s capital island, Santiago, is humid and gets more precipitation than the rest of the arid country, there have been big changes here too. “In recent times, rainfall has been one of the major challenges because, as we know, the climate has changed. It rains less. We spend a lot of money to produce, and when there's a lack of rain, everything is lost,” says Elisabeth. With the changes in climate, Cabo Verde like many other countries, has not only seen a decrease in rain but has also seen an increase in agricultural pests. In 2017, fall armyworm arrived in the country decimating much of the corn crops, and not only. But there has been an increase in many other pests as well. Elisabeth recounts, “The biggest challenge from 2016 until now has been pests, such as the corn earworm, the green stink bug, insects… It is worrying because in Rui Vaz, agriculture is a source of income; it's sustenance for families.” It is these types of concerns that a training offered by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), as part of the FAO-China South-South Cooperation (SSC) Programme, is addressing. Experts from China are passing on expertise to fight these challenges. Through hands-on trainings, Zhiqi Li, an expert in livestock production and Yanhua Zeng, an expert in horticulture, are showing ways of dealing with various issues, such as saving water through proper irrigation techniques or producing organic fertilizer made from manure and other readily available materials. They have also shown farmers how to implement better pest control through pheromone traps and other innovative, non-chemical solutions. With these and more tips, Elizabeth and other farmers in Cabo Verde are seeing an increase in production, despite the erratic rainfall and the pest invasions. As a Small Island Developing State, Cabo Verde is also heavily reliant on imports of food, feed and other goods. Increasing prices of these necessities have put extra pressure on farmers. ©FAO/Giuseppe Carotenuto Cabo Verde is certainly not alone in these climate challenges, but it is a unique country, one made up of 10 islands, nine of which are inhabited. It is part of the arid Sahelian belt of mainland Africa, despite being situated approximately 500 kilometres off the coast and into the Atlantic Ocean. Cabo Verde is part of a group of countries known as Small Island Developing States (SIDS) that face a set of challenges apart from other developing countries and distinct from mainland countries. “The exposure to [soil] erosion is something that really defines a SIDS country… We are in the open sea in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. You can see the wind conditions are higher than in other places,” says Ana Laura Touza, FAO Representative in Cabo Verde. “But there are other issues not related with climate that also define SIDS countries. And those are related with the dependency on the import of food, in particular in the context of the increasing price of staple foods that in recent years have more than doubled,” she continues. Partnerships are all the more important in these contexts. “What we need is to adapt the production system to these challenges and build a smart agriculture. This needs finance, capacity building, innovation and what we see is that we also need very strong cooperation with our partners,” states Gilberto Silva, Minister for Agriculture and Environment of Cabo Verde. With the FAO SSC project, agricultural experts from China are helping farmers take the chance out of agriculture, teaching them affordable and replicable techniques that help them save water, stave off pests and increase yields. ©FAO/Giuseppe Carotenuto Elisabeth finishes harvesting the beans and goes home to see her daughter off to school. Her mom, her sister and her daughter are in the kitchen taking out the “couscous” corn cake, a homemade specialty in Cabo Verde. This dense cake served with eggs or beans give Elisabeth and her sister the energy needed for the afternoon of tending to the livestock and preparing the land, implementing the new techniques she learned in the training sessions on horticulture production, soil management and pest control. “Agriculture is important to me because I see it as a cradle. It's where I grew up, and I teach my daughter its importance. I want her to understand its significance… But in recent years, it has become very uncertain due to severe drought, numerous pests, and it's not something you can have confidence in. It's a matter of chance,” comments Elisabeth. Her words ring true to many of Cabo Verde’s farmers and even beyond these borders. It explains in great part the migration of youth to cities and away from agriculture. Yet, this is a perception that FAO, particularly through the SSC project, is working to dispel. Nature cannot be controlled, but agriculture doesn’t need to be based on chance. Solutions that China has utilized with success in its own rural landscapes are now being adapted and applied in the context of this SIDS country. Elisabeth understands the soil better now and how to provide it with nutrients with organic manure. She hopes to attend even more training, particularly on greenhouse cultivation, where again chance plays a lesser role. Learning that there are even simple solutions to complex challenges, Elisabeth and other farmers are also gaining new motivation and new trust in this sector. “In agriculture, I also want the opportunity to show the world its importance, its advantages... because there’s nothing better than producing for yourself, having for yourself and harvesting for yourself,” concludes Elisabeth. The FAO-China SSC programme is working in 19 countries to pass on innovations, shared expertise and replicable practices. With all countries battling climate change in different ways, it is critical that experiences and solutions are shared among them through partnerships like the FAO-Cabo Verde-China cooperation. The FAO SSC programme has successfully implemented numerous projects in countries across Africa, Latin America, the Caribbean and Asia, contributing to agrifood system transformation through increased agricultural productivity and profitability and improved value chains and investments.

      "article_text": "FAO’s Rehabilitation of Forest Landscapes and Degraded Lands project in Rigan, the Islamic Republic of Iran is proving that environmental conservation can go hand-in-hand with economic empowerment. ©FAO/Mehdi Ansari Jovini Amidst the picturesque desert landscapes of Rigan in the Islamic Republic of Iran’s southeastern Kerman province, one community is witnessing a remarkable revival of its culinary tradition while upholding environmental sustainability. Such a transformation is the fruit of the Rehabilitation of Forest Landscapes and Degraded Lands (RFLDL) project, an initiative led by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and funded by the Global Environment Facility (GEF). The project has become a catalyst for economic empowerment and environmental conservation in Rigan, with local communities and rural women at its core. Known for its cultivation of dates, citrus, sesame and henna, Rigan nonetheless faces a significant threat from desertification. Characterized by its expansive plains and towering mountains, Rigan experiences temperatures that can soar above 50 degrees Celsius during the peak of summer. The area is dotted with date palms and citrus orchards that thrive in its more tropical zones. However, land degradation and biodiversity loss are acute, primarily due to unsustainable agricultural practices and deforestation. These issues are compounded by overgrazing, excessive harvests of forest products and the relentless movement of sands, all of which exacerbate wind erosion and diminish the efficacy of watershed ecosystems. In addition, communities have traditionally depended on wood and shrubs for fuel for their mud ovens, a practice that further led to deforestation and environmental degradation. As one of its responses, FAO’s RFLDL project distributed 750 gas ovens and 500 wood-efficient stoves, especially when compared to mud stoves, cutting down deforestation while helping the revival of the traditional Komaj bread making. Komaj bread, a delicacy infused with the sweetness of dates and aromatic cardamom, complemented by the earthy tones of cumin—a staple spice of the region—is at the heart of this revival. The switch to gas furnaces has enabled the women of Rigan to increase the production of Komaj bread, transforming it from a household staple to a source of income. This shift not only preserves a treasured culinary tradition but also provides new economic prospects for the community's women, who can sell their product at the local markets, further contributing to their economic resilience.

In Rigan, in particular, the project supported villages to restore 2 250 hectares of farm and rangeland by growing drought- and saline- resistant plants. 1 650 of these hectares were planted with species that can be safely irrigated by wastewater. The project actively involved locals in rehabilitating their ecosystem and implementing sustainable land management practices. Communities received training on the importance of conservation and were provided with the tools to engage in such practices. Furthermore, the project’s establishment of local microcredit funds reduced pressure on forest and natural resources. In an effort to diversify income sources away from solely forest products, the project encouraged the cultivation of alfalfa, date trees and medicinal plants, as well as the breeding of turkeys. Additionally, it supported a range of craft and artisan skills such as needlework, sewing, handicrafts and the spinning of palm fibres. Through technical training and knowledge dissemination, the RFLDL project ensured that its lessons and best practices reached a broad audience, fostering a culture of learning and adaptation. This educational component is vital for the sustainability of the project's outcomes, equipping community members with the skills needed to continue their conservation efforts. The project has highlighted the critical role of women in driving sustainable development and conservation efforts. While the revival of Komaj bread showcases how traditional practices can be reimagined to support both the community members’ livelihoods and the planet. ©FAO/Mehdi Ansari Jovini RFLDL has illuminated that environmental conservation and economic development are not mutually exclusive. The revival of Komaj bread making in Rigan stands as a symbol of this harmonious blend, showcasing how traditional practices can be reimagined to support both livelihoods and the planet. The critical role of women in promoting and contributing to sustainable development and the importance of integrating cultural heritage into conservation efforts is another testament of success. As Rigan's women bake their Komaj bread in gas furnaces, they are not just preserving a culinary tradition; they are leading the way in rural development, proving that even the simplest changes can lead to significant impacts.

      "article_text": "In the Churia region of Nepal, a watershed area with severe land degradation exacerbated by the effects of climate change, Gita Adikhari and her fellow community members are learning more effective and environmentally friendly agricultural techniques through an FAO Farmer Field School, financed by the Green Climate Fund. ©FAO/ Sewa Bhattarai Gita Adikhari realised something significant had changed when her farm in the Jhapa District of eastern Nepal yielded nearly double the amount she would normally harvest. The bumper potato crop was not by chance, but as a result of learnings from a Farmer Field School (FFS) run by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) with funding from the Green Climate Fund. The increased yield of potatoes “was like confirmation that we were doing things right, and it motivated me to keep learning and improving our farming methods for even better results later on,” says the 47-year-old farmer. The region in which the FFS are concentrated is Churia, the watershed area of the country, where Gita and her fellow students also live. This region faces an array of environmental issues, such as deforestation, soil erosion and loss of biodiversity. These challenges coupled with the impacts of the climate crisis are putting pressure on local community members’ livelihoods. As rainfall becomes increasingly erratic and temperatures rise, Gita says: “We're seeing crops struggle to grow like they used to, and sometimes they fail altogether.” In order to reduce pressure on forests, farmers are learning how to cultivate forage and plant trees for fodder on their own land. This helps to curb uncontrolled grazing and the depletion of the soils. ©FAO/ Sewa Bhattarai An overarching aim of the learnings is to make farming systems more resilient to climate change. For example, in order to reduce pressure on forests for fuelwood and forage, the FFS trains farmers to cultivate forage and plant trees for fodder on their own land and to collect dung and urine from livestock for liquid fertilizer and compost. These practices all help to curb open and uncontrolled grazing and the depletion of the soils. Thanks to the project’s restoration efforts, 11.48 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent will be reduced over the next 20 years. Since attending the trainings, Gita says, “I've changed a lot of things on the farm. Before, I didn't know much about farming practices, so I used chemical fertilizers without really understanding their harmful effects or how much to use. I also didn't know which crops to grow together. But now, I've started using jholmol (homemade bio-fertilizer and bio-pesticide) and compost made from manure.” Another important element that the FFS demonstrates is how to use biochar, a charcoal-like substance made from crop residue, to improve the soil and mulching techniques to conserve soil moisture. These practices are used alongside intercropping to make cultivation more efficient while providing organic matter to fertilise the new crops. Farmer Field Schools are also about boosting the confidence of women farmers who traditionally have not had a voice in household or community decisions. Gita feels that this has changed and now shares her opinions and gets involved in the community. ©FAO/ Sewa Bhattarai Growing confidence Although Gita’s husband runs a small shop in the community, many of the men in the region are working overseas. Therefore, Gita describes, “The majority of the farm work falls on women's shoulders. This means we have to juggle between farm work and household chores, which can be tough. Plus, we often lack the proper infrastructure and knowledge to work efficiently, which affects our productivity.” Though women are doing the majority of the work, they still struggle with having a voice in decisions due to cultural and traditional norms. Gita explains, “In our rural community, women don't get many opportunities to speak up or share their thoughts openly because of our culture. It's just how things have always been, and it made me feel like my voice didn't matter as much.” For this reason, the FFS works with the women, not only to gain a better living from their land but also to raise their confidence. “I'm no longer afraid to share my opinions and get involved in the community,” says Gita. Actively involving women in decisions on agriculture and managing rural resources enhances the community’s resilience and promotes greater gender equality, says Gita. Her role is particularly crucial as the leader of the 22 women out of 28 students. Despite the challenges, “I have hope for the future of the Churia region. With proper conservation efforts and sustainable practices, we can work towards restoring the health of the ecosystem,” Gita says. It’s that aspiration which is at the heart of the project. Working closely with a range of actors including all levels of government and community-based organizations, the project is helping Gita and her fellow farmers build up both their own confidence and their region’s future.

      "article_text": "Cocoa producers in Côte d'Ivoire have faced increasing climate challenges, as cocoa crops are highly sensitive to weather changes. With support from FAO and the Green Climate Fund, they have adopted agroforestry practices, making the crops more resilient and boosting yields. ©FAO/Amanda Bradley Over the past two years, the cocoa trees in Monique N'Guessan Amlan’s plantation in eastern Côte d'Ivoire have been steadily perking up. That marks a change from before, when several were drying out and dying altogether under the relentless onslaught of the tropical sun, making it hard for the 64-year-old widow to support her four children, who are still studying. “I've noticed that the cocoa trees are developing well, and the yield from my plantation has increased considerably,” Monique says. Her yield has gone up from between 120-150 kilograms per hectare to more than 250 kilograms per hectare. Moreover, it’s not only the quantity of cocoa that’s improved but also the quality and the environmental sustainability, which is good news because, as she says, “International buyers are attaching increasing importance to the sustainability of farming practices.” She began to see this change after she signed up to a project implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and financed by the Green Climate Fund (GCF). Together with the Government of Côte d'Ivoire, the project teaches cocoa farmers agroforestry practices in place of the traditional, full-sun cocoa cultivation that often involves tree felling. The project known as PROMIRE, or Promoting Deforestation-Free Cocoa Production to Reduce Emissions, aims to build climate resilience and reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Côte d’Ivoire’s cocoa value chain. Under the project, Monique received several fruit trees and other species to plant alongside the cocoa trees, offering them more shade. She was also provided with an equipment kit to help with better pruning, drainage and harvesting. Cocoa crops are highly sensitive to weather changes, such as rising temperatures and less predictable rainfall patterns that result from climate change. The country’s main cocoa producing regions have already been affected by heavy rainfall and flooding, and fears of a declining cocoa supply have sent prices soaring to record highs, increasing by 136 percent between July 2022 and February 2024, with cocoa stock futures topping USD 10 000 for the first time. Monique’s cocoa trees have perked up over the last two years, with the yield increasing from between 120-150 kilograms per hectare to more than 250 kilograms per hectare. Top/left: ©FAO/Mino Randrianarison. Right/bottom: ©FAO/Amanda Bradley Monique says when she first heard about the PROMIRE project, she was unsure whether it would be of much help to her. The death of her husband almost 20 years ago had left her with not just an emotional void, but also a shortage of the resources needed to cultivate her one-hectare cocoa plantation and provide for her family. But now, she says, “The support I receive reinforces my conviction that change is possible. If I live a long life, I know that I’ll be happy thanks to the benefits of the trees I’m planting now.” She hopes to raise awareness of the challenges faced, especially by widowed cocoa producers in the same position as her, and encourage them to join the project “so that we can create fairer conditions for men and women farmers, guaranteeing a sustainable future for our families and our communities.” It’s not just about tackling deforestation and the impacts of climate change on the cocoa trees, but also working to help men and women farmers become more digitally savvy and make use of innovation to develop their leadership and business skills. In practical terms, so far, two new organic cocoa production cooperatives have also been created under the project. The clearing of tropical forests for full-sun cocoa plantations has been a major driver of deforestation. The FAO-GCF project has seen nearly 1 400 hectares of conventional cocoa plots converted to agroforestry or agro-ecosystems. ©FAO/Zana Ouattara Since the initiative began, the project has directly benefited 1 743 people and some 317 hectares of forest have been restored or maintained in the Agnéby-Tiassa, La Mé and Sud-Comoé regions of the country, along with nearly 1 400 hectares of conventional cocoa plots converted to agroforestry or agro-ecosystems. Reducing the carbon footprint of cocoa production is crucial for mitigating climate change impacts. While enhancing traceability through various forms of certification is key to improving cocoa supply chain sustainability and promoting fair-trade cocoa. Fuelled by export demand to satisfy the world’s chocolate consumers, the clearing of dense, tropical forests for full-sun cocoa plantations has been a major driver of deforestation. But now, the European Union (EU) has put in place a new deforestation regulation (EUDR) that is set to come into force by the end of the year. It is aimed at ensuring that the products EU citizens consume do not contribute to deforestation or forest degradation worldwide. With half of the country’s cocoa exports going to the EU, that brings added urgency to the PROMIRE initiative’s innovative work with producers like Monique to transform the cocoa value chain, enhancing traceability, protecting forests and mitigating climate change.

      "article_text": "Through an FAO-supported training, Blessing Andrew, the sole practicing woman veterinary paraprofessional in Sanga in Nigeria’s southern Kaduna State, realized that she could be a vital resource to the many women farmers who need access to animal health care. ©FAO/Habila Umar With a client base of around 500 farmers, Blessing Andrew is an active veterinary animal health worker in her community. In fact, she is the sole practicing woman veterinary paraprofessional (VPP) in Sanga, in Nigeria’s southern Kaduna State. In general, the animal health profession remains heavily male-dominated across most of Sub-Saharan Africa, including Nigeria, where women comprise an estimated 20-30 percent of the national animal health workforce. Despite being a qualified paraprofessional with a two-year diploma in this field, Blessing found farmers questioning her competence and abilities, particularly in handling large ruminants. She was also often paid less for providing the same services as her male counterparts, with Blessing at times operating at a loss. Given these disparities, Blessing struggled to motivate herself to continue down this career path, although the demand for her services was high. A tailored training for VPPs, provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in collaboration with the Ahmadu Bello University’s College of Agriculture and Animal Science renewed her drive to stay in this field. “Before the VPP training, I was running my practice with no motivation due to the little profit I made and sometimes I thought of quitting. After participating in the VPP training, I dusted off the equipment I had abandoned and began to take my practice seriously. I’m glad it paid off,” Blessing describes. FAO’s gender-responsive approach emphasizes reaching women by offering training to all those who manage livestock, understanding the division of tasks and decision-making within households and employing communication and techniques that are gender-sensitive. The work of women as animal health professionals is crucial in bridging gender gaps in access to veterinary services in Nigeria. ©FAO/Habila Umar In Blessing’s community, social norms have an impact on women’s ability to access care. Women’s interactions with unrelated men are often restricted, exacerbating their already limited access to quality preventive animal healthcare. Women are typically responsible for the day-to-day care of animals, such as feeding, cleaning, milking or collecting eggs, strategically positioning them as early detectors of disease symptoms. Yet, the male heads of households are traditionally the ones to initiate, interact with the VPPs and pay for animal health services. This exclusion of women from discussions with male VPPs can also result in incomplete assessments or inaccurate diagnoses. This is a global reality. Despite women constituting 60 percent of small-scale livestock keepers, FAO estimates that women receive only five percent of global agricultural extension services. The gender gap in access to veterinary service holds women farmers back from realizing their full potential of enhancing farm production and safeguarding their livestock from diseases. Through her training, Blessing realized that she could be a crucial resource to the many women farmers, in particular, who needed the support of animal health professionals. By tapping into the existing gap in the veterinary service market, Blessing has been able to leverage women clients as an opportunity to grow her business. But she also realized that she could act as an agent of change primarily by building relationships with farming households and changing her approach. After FAO’s training, Blessing began taking the time with male clients to explain to them the benefits of involving their wives in service delivery and investing in vaccination plans for the goat herds or chicken flocks under their wives’ care. Over time, as farmers saw positive results from her advice, Blessing noticed a shift in farmer’s perceptions of her and has been able to gradually grow her business through client referrals. Blessing focuses on building relationships with farming households and advocates for women’s involvement in animal health decisions. ©FAO/Habila Umar Gender is often overlooked as a factor influencing the provision of veterinary services. While women VPPs can be a vital channel for reaching female smallholders, they still make up the minority in their profession and, like Blessing, face gender-specific constraints themselves in their work. By carefully developing gender-responsive models for training VPPs, FAO is supporting women farmers’ access to quality veterinary services, measures which are essential for boosting livestock productivity, supporting household expenses and improving family nutrition. After her training, Blessing now stands shoulder-to-shoulder with her male VPP counterparts in the community, progress which has brought her a sense of pride and motivation to continue her essential work in veterinary practice. Her client base has grown, from approximately 300 to 500. Notably, she has doubled her female farmer client base from100 to 200. She has also doubled her monthly income allowing her to provide for her family and upkeep her house. Through the training of VPPs in Nigeria, Uganda and South Africa, FAO is improving the quality of VPP services and outreach to women farmers. To date FAO has trained 645 VPPs and veterinarians on gender sensitive animal health service delivery. Learn more"

      "article_text": "Sita Thapa using the tractor from the custom hiring centre to plough the field. ©Umang Shahi/ FAO By 2050, the world’s population is projected to reach 10 billion, with regions like Asia experiencing the highest growth rates. This is expected to pose a significant challenge to food security and nutrition. It is thus important to focus on enhancing the capacities of smallholder farmers, primarily women, who play a crucial role in producing one-third of the world’s food. In Nepal, where the constitution safeguards women's rights, ensuring their representation in government, equal property rights, and protection against violence or exploitation, women form over 70 percent of the agricultural workforce. Despite their substantial contribution to the sector, which contributes a quarter of the GDP and employs two thirds of the population, they face under-representation in resource governance and leadership positions. Despite challenges, such as limited access to resources and services, including land, finance, training, and inputs, women continue to play integral roles in agriculture, contributing significantly to household nutrition and food security. With this in mind, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), in collaboration with the Government of Nepal has been instrumental in putting in place gender equality and empowerment initiatives through local cooperatives, like the Rajdevi Agriculture Cooperative from Lahan in Madhesh Province. Gender quality and female empowerment is at the core of FAO’s Strategic Framework , as it helps achieve better life, but also better production and better nutrition. The efforts of the cooperative have significantly transformed livelihoods in the community, with women and minority groups actively participating in various economic activities. The Technical Support for Sustainable Agricultural Mechanization of Smallholder Farms for Enhancing Agricultural Productivity and Production and Reducing Drudgery of Women and Young Farmers and the United Nations Joint Programme on Accelerating Progress Towards the Economic Empowerment of Rural Women (JP RWEE), implemented in Madhesh province have supported women towards in achieving greater economic and professional autonomy. Through partnerships with key institutions like the Agricultural Mechanization Promotion Centre (AMPC), FAO Nepal is empowering women to actively participate in mechanization and decision-making processes. The establishment of Custom Hiring Centre (CHCs)that supply farm implements at subsidized rateshas greatly benefited women and young farmers inMadhesh. At the Ganesh Digo Krishi Yantrikaran Kendra in Siraha District I witnessed how the provision of timely mechanization services for various crops was reducing drudgery. The cooperative serves more than 650 beneficiaries across more than 100 hectares of land, resulting in increased cropping intensity and an improved value proposition. This sustainable agricultural mechanization addresses labour shortages, resulting in improved productivity, livelihoods, and by giving women access to these machineries, enhances their economic independence and social empowerment. Through capacity development initiatives, FAO Nepal is helping women transition to leadership roles, gain technical skills, and access resources, which has resulted in reducing their manual labour and enhanced their empowerment. Many women have doubled their production, contributing to achieving SDG 2 - zero hunger. The family's living status has shifted from having no resources to accumulating savings and making investments for the future. Households are currently consuming a higher number of healthy calories, and there is a considerable decline in the rates of early childhood mortality and an improvement in children's nutritional health. Crop intensity has grown by 33 percent and ownership of household assets has also increased, rising from 40 percent to 61 percent when compared to the 2011 Census report. To reduce gender disparities, FAO Nepal works with all levels of government to develop policies and build capacities that promote gender equality and women's empowerment, which contributes towards eradicating hunger, food insecurity, and malnutrition. FAO Nepal also collaborates with various stakeholders to integrate gender equality into principles and international standards for food security and nutrition. The progress towards gender equality and women’s empowerment in Nepal's agricultural sector is promising. By recognizing and harnessing the invaluable contributions of women in agriculture, Nepal stands to achieve greater prosperity, resilience, and sustainability in its agrifood systems, ultimately advancing better life and key SDGs.

Although traditionally underrepresented, young Africans, women in particular, are now working to bridge the data gap in their countries in the hope of improving the agricultural landscape in Africa. Amid the lush savannahs of Côte d'Ivoire, Désirée Christelle and Deborah Conan arrive in the Dabou region, specifically in the village of Konou, as part of a master’s programme in agricultural statistics under the Global Strategy to Improve Agricultural and Rural Statistics (GSARS) programme . Led by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and supported by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and the European Union, this programme is a long-term initiative to enable the production of more and better agricultural statistics in developing countries. The village of Konou is particularly known for its rubber, palm tree and cassava production, and Désirée and Deborah have come to understand the agricultural process behind the numbers. “Does it yield as much as it used to? What changes have occurred in productivity?” Désirée asks a group of local farmers. Their answers will help these young agricultural statisticians learn how statistical theory applies to real life agricultural production and yield."

The good news is that women’s roles and contribution in the agrifood sector are increasingly reflected in climate plans too – around two-thirds of countries’ nationally determined contributions (NDCs) prioritize gender equality and social inclusion for effective agrifood systems adaptation.

Early marriage and economic violence are two forms of GBV that are very common in rural farming communities in Syria. In response, FAO is implementing two pilot projects to promote the prevention of Violence Against Women and Girls in Homs and Rural Damascus governorates. The prevention of VAWG pilots are implemented by FAO under the Building Local Resilience in Syria (BLRS) project, funded by UK Aid, and in collaboration with UNFPA. The pilots target a total of 3 000 individuals in 31 villages across both governorates and are a push towards achieving long-term social and economic empowerment, greater gender equality in rights and responsibilities, and greater agency and autonomy for women and girls. The pilots consist of two interventions which are being pioneered by FAO for the first time in the Near East – North Africa (NENA) region. These interventions are designed to complement each other through a gender-transformative approach that addresses VAWG on both the community level through the implementation of Dimitra Clubs, and on the household level with the Discussion Group Series (DGS). “Economic violence happens in many forms,” says Suzan Al-Ostaz, FAO’s national gender specialist. “Many women in rural communities work for little to no wage and end up having no control over their income or get excluded from discussions on household economics. They are also often unable to access the resources that are needed to empower themselves economically due to discrimination.” she adds. Learn more"

It was honeybee venom (apitoxin) that captured her interest for its potential in treating patients with diabetes. With this new drive, she turned into an entrepreneur, fuelled by a contest held by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). Ever since she was a child, Solongo desired to help people. At 15 years old, she volunteered to teach English to underprivileged girls. As a teenager, she collected old clothes for orphans and street children. In her twenties, with her background in economics, she started working in the government and international organizations to advocate for policies benefiting children and women. However, it was during her maternity leave that she began to research the therapeutic effects of honeybee venom. The more she learned, the more she realized that she could leverage this scientific knowledge to develop innovative products, such as pain relief balms and restorative ointments, derived from bee venom. She started “Magic Bee Foods”, and despite the early difficulties that come with any start-up company, Solongo stayed determined.

Early marriage is one of these forms, taking away a girl’s opportunity for education and gaining skills to be independent. ©FAO/ Andrea Sanchez Enciso When asked about what constitutes gender-based violence, women participating in Dimitra Clubs in Niger shared that they feel the violence in many forms. Physical and sexual abuse are obvious manifestations, but women also felt that pervasive social norms, such as not being able to remarry after being widowed, not being involved in households’ financial decisions and not being allowed to participate in certain community activities, made them feel like lesser members or outcasts of their communities. Along with this, a big issue for women in many communities is being forced to marry or being married at an early age. In Niger, 76 percent of girls are married before the age of 18. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, it is almost a third of girls. This is also true in rural Senegal, where 31 percent of girls are married before the age of 18 and nine percent before 15. Beyond being a violation of human rights, child marriage diminishes development efforts and halts the progress and production of societies. This practice hinders girl children from earning an education, limiting their options later in life. It leads to increased health issues, with young women facing more complications during pregnancies and childbirth. Early marriage also breeds a reliance on men as young women often have had little schooling or opportunity to gain the skills to make their own living. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has implemented several projects in rural Senegal to raise awareness among all members of the community about the dangers of this practice, for girl children but also for the community at large.

This is in one of the country’s primary agricultural hubs, and drives Colombia’s agro-industrial, commercial, and ecotourism sectors. Additionally, it serves as a significant agricultural reservoir, dispatching approximately 9,000 tonnes of agricultural and livestock products daily to other parts of the country. However, out of the two million hectares available for farming, only 520,363 hectares are cultivated. That’s just 22% of the potential area. Furthermore, the food system's dynamics are flawed: most of the produce isn't consumed locally but is instead sent to different regions of Colombia through a complex network of middlemen. Felicita Valderrama, a farmer and victim of the armed conflict, who came to Meta in search of better opportunities after being displaced, expressed the harsh realities of this system. \"The hardest thing for us farmers is that we have to take it to the middleman, because we suffer a lot to produce. You work and work every day, and when the time comes to harvest the crop, you go to offer it, and they pay you very little. That is disheartening.\""

Her mom was a nurse who used to go to rural villages to treat women. “She often told me about women who were victims of gender-based violence but who depended on their husbands to feed themselves and their children,” she recalls, adding “Sadly, this is still happening today.” “Most of the issues affecting women are because they are not financially independent; so they have to rely on abusive husbands or family members,” explains Fatmata. “They [rural women] deserve equal opportunities, but society makes it very difficult.” Today, through her work as a gender and youth expert in Sierra Leone’s Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security, she helps rural women access technical training, inputs or other opportunities to make the most of their agricultural activities. In another remote village, Foday Kamara grew up in a subsistence farming family. They often lacked adequate food for all family members. This led his parents to send him at the age of 10 to live with his aunt. Today he is the director of a local NGO that supports youth and women’s empowerment. Fatmata and Foday’s commitment to championing rural women in Sierra Leone led them to participate in a project of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) implemented in collaboration with the NGO Solidaridad West Africa. The project equips women and men with the skills and knowledge to thrive in the agricultural sector through responsible investments in agriculture. It also strengthens the position of rural women to be able to participate in decision-making processes. Once equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge, Fatmata and Foday were ready to train other rural women in the district of Kambia. ©FAO/ Aurelia Rusek From subsistence farming to responsible agribusiness Two-thirds of families in Sierra Leone rely on subsistence farming and petty trading as sources of food and income. Rural women rarely have another source of income on which to rely. “Being able to invest in their agricultural activities represents a qualitative leap forward that would enable rural women in particular to shift from subsistence farming to agribusiness, expanding their economic opportunities,” continues Maud Oustry, FAO Capacity Development Expert. However, despite significant efforts to level the field for women in recent years, gender inequality is still prevalent in Sierra Leone. While nearly 80 percent of employed women in the country work in the agrifood sector, they face significant barriers to access basic resources such as land, training or services. “Most rural women farmers are illiterate. They don’t have business skills, and they can rarely access finance. Even if they do, perceptions and societal norms are a hurdle,” explains Fatmata. \"If women had the same access to productive resources, services and decision-making processes as men, they would be able to invest in agriculture, develop their agricultural activities and become agri-entrepreneurs with their own businesses,” explains Oustry. In November 2022, FAO and Solidaridad launched a capacity development programme for rural women as part of the project in Sierra Leone. It aims to enable women to access decent employment in agriculture and to themselves make responsible investments in agriculture as entrepreneurs. The first step is building the skills of rural women and promoting their participation in decision-making processes. “Women do most of the agricultural work but when it comes to decision making, it’s the men. They decide about everything: production, selling, use of resources,” explains Foday. Raising awareness of women’s rights Fatmata and Foday, along with 25 other representatives of rural women’s organizations, participated in a Training of Trainers. “The material was oriented to help them [rural women] analyze their situation, identify the challenges that prevent them from investing in agriculture and outline potential solutions to address them,” explains Foday. In order to ensure women are informed about their rights, the participants also studied regulatory frameworks, including recently enacted legislation that addresses issues such as women's access to finance, employment opportunities, equal pay, maternity leave and protection of customary land rights. “These are rights for which women have been battling for during decades. Knowing about them has given rural women confidence and a sense that things are changing,” tells Fatmata. Towards inclusive decision-making Dialogue sessions were also held where women could present their challenges and recommendations to local authorities and discuss a way forward. “The dialogue sessions were very powerful,” relates Foday. “For instance, women were telling the ordeals they go through to access land despite the new law granting them customary lands rights. Many local decision-makers were unaware of the legislation since its popularization is still underway.” As a result of the dialogue with the paramount chief of Kambia, he committed to coordinate with other village chiefs to ensure that women’s rights are respected. Women were also invited to attend the district council monthly meetings to follow up on other commitments made during the dialogue session. “This is very important because it means women will now be involved in decision-making at local and district level,” explained Fatmata. Similar trainings were held in eight other districts of Sierra Leone and benefitted nearly 300 women in total. ©FAO/ Aurelia Rusek During the training events, participants learned that a responsible investment in agriculture benefits not only the investors but also the communities, including women, men and the environment. It contributes to sustainable development, enhances food security and nutrition and respects human rights. “This was an eye opener for many people because in every community we have had experiences of companies polluting the land and waters. Now we know that we not only need to ask for a fee for land use but also ensure that their investments are sustainable, environmentally, economically and socially,” explains Fatmata. By the end of 2024, the programme will have worked with 420 rural women and 210 local male leaders on the importance of women's participation in decision-making processes. As a next step, FAO and Solidaridad are following up on the commitments made to improve rural women's participation in responsible agricultural investments. Learn more"

      "article_text": "One project in Panama is helping to increase the income of Indigenous coffee producers by enhancing the production and sales of coffee. ©FAO/Cecilia Calatrava Long before the sun rises above the towering trees of the Panamanian rainforest, Elizabeth Méndez, a Guna Indigenous Woman, wakes up to the sound of her rooster crowing. She lives in a house made of bamboo and thatch, nestled deep in the lush green forests. This is where she and her family have been growing coffee for generations. Elizabeth’s busy day begins with the distinct aroma of freshly brewed coffee, which for her, signifies much more than a morning kickstart to her day. Coffee has long been an important source of income for many Indigenous Peoples in Panama. But, in recent years, these communities have struggled to maintain their traditional methods of production. “I’ve been harvesting coffee since I was a little girl, but sometimes we didn’t understand what was going on with the plant: sometimes it looked sick, sometimes it would not yield much,” says Elizabeth. “The other main challenge we’ve always faced is where and how to sell the coffee. When we harvest, sometimes we have nowhere to sell it and sometimes we sell it cheap,” she adds. With the advent of an innovative project called “Support for post-COVID economic recovery for Indigenous coffee producers,” this is hopefully a scenario of the past for the coffee farmers in the Ngäbe, Guna, Emberá and Wounaan Indigenous Peoples’ communities participating in the project. The project is an initiative of the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) with funding from the Japan Special Fund Poverty Reduction Program. It was implemented with the technical assistance of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and with the support of Panama’s Ministry of Agricultural Development, as well as coffee company, Café Durán. The project’s goal was to increase the income of Indigenous coffee producers by enhancing the production, processing, quality and sales of coffee from sustainable agroforestry. More than 150 Indigenous coffee farmers from four communities completed a season-long, FAO Farmers Field Schools’ training in sustainable agroecological practices that enhance resilience to climate change and improve the quantity and quality of production while being aligned with and building upon Indigenous Peoples’ traditional knowledge and cultural practices. These agroecological techniques include minimizing the use of pesticides and adapting agricultural technologies to face the effects of climate change. Through guided discussion and observation, coffee farmers were empowered to become experts in ecology and oversee the agricultural management of their own coffee crops. The training also included learning activities to increase women’s participation in production and business decision-making. “Thanks to the training, we’ve learned all about coffee management and how we can take care of plants when they get sick. All of this without the need to put aside our traditional techniques, and while preserving our ancestral native plants,” says Elizabeth. By partnering with coffee company, Café Durán, Indigenous Peoples’ communities are accessing a new market that is reliable and pays fair prices. ©FAO/Cecilia Calatrava More than just coffee For Elizabeth and other coffee farmers in Panama, the project is not just about making good coffee, it is about building a better future for their families and communities. “Coffee has always been part of our culture, but now we are also seeing it as a potential source of economic relief,” she explains. By partnering with Café Durán and learning best practices for production and processing, Indigenous Peoples’ communities are accessing markets and buyers that are reliable and pay fair prices. In turn, this allows coffee producers to improve their living conditions and offers opportunities for future generations. “In a certain way, coffee is a magical product because it can, not only help with better social inclusion, but it also offers good international prices,” explains FAO Representative in Panama, Adoniram Sanches Peraci. “Indigenous Peoples have tremendous cultural, social, linguistic, historical and territorial wealth. But they also face significant challenges when it comes to translating this wealth into sustainable economic opportunities, especially given their limited access to culturally responsive technical assistance, markets and financing,” says Ana Grigera, Gender and Diversity Specialist at the IDB. “Coordinated work between government authorities, the private sector and Indigenous Peoples in Panama is key,” she adds. Coffee has the potential to provide Indigenous Peoples’ communities with long-term economic, social and environmental sustainability. For this reason, it was chosen as part of FAO’s ‘One Country, One product’ initiative. ©FAO/Cecilia Calatrava The perfect blend When we ask Elizabeth how she expects her life to change, she tells us that she hopes life stays the same, and that she still wakes up at dawn to make her coffee. “But now the coffee will be from my own production,” she says with a warm laugh. “Coffee provides Indigenous Peoples’ communities with long-term economic, social and environmental sustainability and offers them a reliable form of income. Previously, they worked on coffee farms. Today, with the experience that they have acquired from FAO’s Farmer Field Schools, they are the ones who are running their own coffee farms and selling it directly to buyers like us,” says Ricardo Tovar, Coffee Production Director at Café Durán. “I’m encouraging the people of the community, especially the young, to get educated and grow their coffee crops the proper way. Coffee is not a quick solution for income generation for one or two years, but rather it is something that will guarantee our stability in the long term,” says Elizabeth. One Country, One Product In Panama, coffee is part of FAO’s One Country, One Product programme. This initiative places smallholders and family farming at the centre of the production, distribution and marketing of a selected product in each country. It also opens the possibility of fruitful cooperation with the private sector and financial institutions, such as the IDB. “What we want to build is a platform of socio-economic inclusion of more farmers in the productive process, where the private sector has the market ‘know-how,’” says Peraci of the project. FAO provides a wide range of technical assistance and investment support. Through its Investment Centre, FAO helps to transform agrifood systems for inclusive economic growth and a more sustainable future. Learn more"

It was not effective. It was tiresome. We had to fetch water from the wetland using jerry cans and carry them on our heads up the hillside. The partners then gave us irrigation facilities, and we are no longer recording the cases of malnutrition as food productivity increases,” she said. “The solar-powered irrigation is currently covering all the hectares we have. We also save money to ensure the facility’s maintenance.” The rural women participants have also built wealth worth over Rwf 200 million (USD 163 000 approx.) by earning, saving, and investing money generated from the solar-powered vegetable production. The JP RWEE programme is a global initiative with an overarching goal to secure rural women’s livelihoods and rights in the context of sustainable development. The programme is jointly implemented by the three Rome-based UN agencies (RBAs): the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the International Fund for Agriculture Development (IFAD) and the World Food Programme (WFP) plus UN Women, and is delivered in partnership with Rwanda’s Ministry of Gender and Family Promotion, the Rwanda Agriculture and Animal Resources Development Board, and other local organizations such as the Rwanda Rural Rehabilitation Initiative.

JP RWEE is funded by the governments of Norway and Sweden and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Witnessing rural women’s empowerment Representatives from FAO, IFAD and WFP recently toured the Ngoma district to witness the women’s achievements, as part of celebrations for the UN Day for South-South Cooperation. South-South cooperation is a manifestation of solidarity, through the exchange of resources, technology, and knowledge between developing countries, also known as countries of the Global South. It aims to foster self-reliance of developing countries by enhancing their creative capacity to find solutions, strategies, and technological capabilities to address their development challenges. Ye Anping, the Director of FAO’s South-South and Triangular Cooperation Division said during his visit that FAO is committed to providing more assistance to developing countries through South-South and triangular cooperation, adding that supporting rural women is part of preparing a bright future of Rwanda’s population. “The most important thing I saw was the combination of hardware such as the solar-powered irrigation system with investments in capacity building and empowerment activities including the Gender Action Learning System, nutrition and climate change. It is impressive to hear how the cooperative is generating income and reinvesting it,” Ronald Hartman, IFAD’s Director of Global Engagement, Partnerships, and Resource Mobilization said. David Kaatrud, WFP’s Director of the Programme, Humanitarian and Development Division said “I thank the cooperative leadership in leading the effort for everything accomplished. You’ve shown that when you come together you can achieve so much more. As WFP, IFAD, FAO, and UN Women, together with our partners, we want to learn from you because we have a lot to do in Africa. Rural women’s empowerment contributes to community empowerment.” Marie Gloriose Mukayiranga, the Vice Mayor in charge of social affairs in Ngoma district, said that the JP RWEE is highly contributing to the district's socio-economic development. “We will continue to work with the project beneficiaries to ensure sustaining and ownership of gained facilities,” she said. From small things big things grow The rural women farmers supported under the JP RWEE in Ngoma district started as small groups in FAO-led Farmer Field Schools in 2019. They were later supported to buy three hectares of farming land. In 2021, they created a cooperative called Tuzamurane Kigoma which is helping them to earn money through climate-resilient agriculture such as the solar-irrigation and invest their savings in accumulating other income-generating assets. The cooperative comprises 163 members, of whom 144 are women. They grow different types of vegetables, fruits, and maize and raise rabbits for meat. The cooperative has an affordable cold room made from locally-available materials to store vegetables for up to seven days before they are supplied to the market, and a motor vehicle to transport agro-inputs to the farms and harvests to the market. They have also purchased a maize processing unit, two maize drying facilities, and a machine to test for humidity to avoid aflatoxin. They are also constructing a mini market to serve as the harvest selling point. “When we earn income, we save and invest in other projects to build the cooperative’s wealth,” Therese Kansayisa, the cooperative president, said. Under the joint programme, cooperative members have also been trained in areas such as equitable and joint planning, and budgeting. UN Women has supported the cooperative to establish an Early Childhood Development Centre with the local government which serves cooperative members and the nearby community. Through a common kitchen and training materials on how to prepare a balanced diet, cooperative provides food for school meals which contributes to ensuring children’s nutrition. “Children go to the ECD to learn and get a balanced diet while their parents’ work. We are committed to sustaining the gains made thanks to the project,” Therese said."

An initiative of the Organisation of African, Caribbean and Pacific States (OACPS) implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), FISH4ACP is funded by the European Union (EU) and the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ). ©FAO/Giulio Napolitano “Fish farming is my mother’s business,” says Nurudeen Quadri, a 38-year-old fish farmer from Ijebu-Ode in southwest Nigeria as he enters Eriwe farm village. “I have been coming here since I was very small. When I graduated from university, I started my own farm.” Located at two hours’ drive east of Lagos, Nigeria’s sprawling business capital, Eriwe farm village is the site of one of the countries’ biggest catfish clusters. Along the banks of a little river lie the ponds of nearly 600 fish farmers, organized in cooperatives as part of the Eriwe fishers’ union. These farmers produced some 2 000 tonnes of catfish in 2022. It is seven o’clock in the morning, when Nurudeen’s two workers switch on the water pumps and fresh water starts pouring into the fish ponds. “It gives the fish oxygen to open their appetite before they are fed in the afternoon,” Nurudeen says. With the workers, he does maintenance and repairs in and around the ten ponds of his farm, two of which are used for rearing fingerlings. During harvest time, they sell the fish. Nurudeen produces nearly 50 tonnes of catfish per year. Despite the rising cost of feed and limited access to finance, this work allows him to sustain himself and his family.“I can make a good living out of it,” he says. Nigeria has an estimated 285 000 catfish producers, 60 percent of which are small-scale farmers like Nurudeen Quadri (left/top). These businesses employ some one million people, but capital is a major challenge. ©FAO/Giulio Napolitano Mary Stephens and her husband also have a few ponds in Eriwe farm village. But their main business is fish processing. The racks that line the yard of their facility are filled with slices of catfish, sizzling as they are slowly smoked by the charcoal that can be seen glowing underneath. “There are about 150 basins of catfish on the fire now,” Mary says, or some 3 750 kilograms. She adds that most of them come from Eriwe farm. The smoked catfish will be sold at the market in Onitsha, some 300 kilometres to the east. “People, even from abroad, come there and buy our goods.” Capital is the major challenge, says Mary, who has been in this business for 25 years. She hopes to get a machine to replace some of their manual work. She smiles: “Equipment and capital. If all those things are ready, the business will go.” FISH4ACP , a global fish value chain development programme in partnership between FAO, the EU, BMZ and the OACPS, is helping Nigeria to make its catfish sector stronger. Together with Nigeria’s Federal Ministry of Agriculture and Food Security, it carried out an analysis of Nigeria’s catfish sector. The analysis showed the sectors’ importance for people’s livelihoods. Nigeria counts an estimated 285 000 catfish producers, 60 percent of which are small-scale farmers. These businesses employ an estimated one million people. “Catfish is a good business,” says Abubakar Usman, an FAO expert in Nigeria’s catfish sector and lead for the FISH4ACP programme in the country. Demand for fish is huge. With over 223 million people, Nigeria is Africa’s most populous nation, and fish makes up over 40 percent of people’s animal protein intake, of which at least one-quarter is catfish. According to preliminary findings of FISH4ACP’s analysis, annual catfish production could be as high as one million tonnes in 2021, worth around USD 2.6 billion, says Usman. A top priority for the FISH4ACP programme is to bring costs down in Nigeria’s catfish sector. The initiative is additionally working on credit schemes to help farmers finance their operations. ©FAO/Giulio Napolitano Catfish started booming in the 1990s, says Usman, when the government established hatcheries for catfish fingerlings and seed became available. Years of annual growth at over 20 percent followed between 2005 and 2015 before catfish production started declining in 2016, mainly due to rising feed prices. At the top of FISH4ACP’s priorities to strengthen Nigeria’s catfish sector is to bring costs down. At the same time, the initiative is working on a feed credit scheme to help farmers finance their operations before the money comes in at harvest time. There are concerns about sustainability too. Traditional fish smoking can affect human health, while the use of firewood contributes to deforestation. FISH4ACP is supporting the introduction of innovative smoking kilns that use less wood and reduce people’s exposure to smoke. It’s late afternoon when Nurudeen, waiting for his turn to join the daily football match of fish farmers and workers, reflects on ways to grow his business. The good thing about Eriwe farm village is that farmers work together to make things better, he says. The farmers of Eriwe want to go into fish processing, and they are restricting intermediaries from entering the farm so they can negotiate prices directly with buyers. “We are telling people that catfish is not only for rich people. It’s for everybody,” Nurudeen says. “The more they consume, the bigger the demand.” FISH4ACP can make a difference by working with clusters like Eriwe farm village, says Usman. Together, the programme and cooperatives have the capacity to rise up to the challenge of making Nigeria’s catfish sector more resilient, efficient and environmentally friendly. “If you touch the lives of fish farmers here, the whole country can follow.” Just before entering the football pitch, Nurudeen says: “I like fish farming. It gives you a bright future and lets you give back to the society, because invariably you are feeding the nation.” Water is life; water is food. It is a driving force for people, economies and nature and the foundation of our food systems. But this precious resource is not infinite. In the run up to World Food Day on October 16, we take the opportunity to thank the #FoodHeroes who are taking #WaterAction to manage water wisely, while providing food for us now and in the future - leaving no one behind .

      "article_text": "Without the anticipatory action that FAO helped roll out in Viet Nam before Typhoon Noru, the loss of livestock, essential possessions, and even lives, could have been much worse. ©FAO/ Nguyen Minh Duc At first, there didn't seem to be much reason for concern. By the end of it, the trail of destruction had left few homes, crops and livestock unscathed. Nguyen Hue, an 84-year-old farmer, recalls: “When the first warnings came through over the loudspeakers, we went to take shelter nearby in a neighbour’s stronger house with a second storey. We only have a one-storey house here, and it is weak. We sat through the night hearing the strong winds blow through.” The Category 1 typhoon ripped through Da Nang and three other provinces of Viet Nam, tearing roofs off of houses, destroying fields, harming and even killing people and livestock. And yet, the impact could have been much worse. That's in no small part due to the anticipatory action that the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) rolled out before Typhoon Noru struck in late September 2022. As Hoang Thi Thuan, a 59-year-old from the Quang Tri province who fell victim to the typhoon's wrath, later put it: “I had a means of ensuring we were not only safe, but we could eat and buy some extras.” Typhoon Noru unfolds The European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) first issued alerts of a possible tropical storm on 22 September, six days before expected landfall on Viet Nam's Quang Binh province. FAO and the Viet Nam Disaster Management Authority (VDMA) decided to closely monitor how the situation might evolve. Sure enough, by noon of the next day, the ECMWF had upgraded its forecast to a potential typhoon hitting the central provinces in the coming days. Communities in these provinces are no strangers to typhoons. But while they have shown remarkable resilience in the face of these recurring and increasingly extreme weather shocks, they are struggling to cope in recent years, owing in part to the impact of a global pandemic and the ensuing economic crises. On Saturday, 24 September, wind speeds were forecast to pass the trigger threshold of 90 kilometres per hour, and the typhoon was officially named Noru. That's when FAO's anticipatory actions kicked in . Within 48 hours, actions were implemented in the six communes closest to the predicted landfall of Typhoon Noru. As part of the anticipatory actions, FAO distributed 600 watertight drums, provided multi-purpose cash transfers and enacted an early warning communication plan. ©FAO/ Nguyen Minh Duc The essential ingredient of anticipatory action is consultation with local communities and governments, as they can articulate their own concerns and identify appropriate responses and solutions. Such consultations were conducted well in advance in Viet Nam. They started with officials at both national and provincial levels and were followed up with a series of meetings at community level involving nearly 400 participants. A set of anticipatory actions determined through the consultations were also simulated in Quang Tri province in August 2022 to better prepare for a potential activation. With funding made available by the Directorate-General for European Civil Protection and Humanitarian Aid Operations (ECHO) and with on-the-ground support from the local government and community leaders, FAO distributed 600 watertight drums, provided multi-purpose cash transfers and enacted an early warning communication plan that spanned television, loudspeaker, radio and messaging applications. Three days prior to Typhoon Noru making landfall, Hoang Thi Do describes receiving warnings through the loudspeaker with information about what to do. “I had enough time to prepare before it [the typhoon] came. I knew it was coming.” Like in past years during such extreme weather events, she quickly packed some personal belongings and essential items, like food, clothes and drinking water, into the watertight drums and moved with her mother to the upper floor of her house. Hoang Thi Do states that the support given ahead of Noru allowed her to “stay dry and well fed.” The anticipatory action plan was simulated weeks before the typhoon to better prepare for a potential activation. ©FAO/ Nguyen Minh Duc Cash payments were also hugely beneficial to the communities, offering the greatest flexibility on how to best protect themselves and their families. The cash was primarily used to buy food, as well as medicines and materials to strengthen their homes ahead of the storm. Le Thi Vi, an 84-year-old farmer, said of the cash: “We went straight to the store and bought meat, fish cans and some milk and stored it in our new drum. We were able to keep eating healthy throughout the event, and we felt confident we would be okay in the aftermath, when roads and markets are hard to reach.\" Typhoon Noru made landfall at 1:00 am on 28 September, between Da Nang and Quang Nam province, with wind speeds of up to 155 kilometres per hour and more than 429 millimetres of rain in some areas. The result was over 7 000 damaged or collapsed houses. It also decimated over 5 000 hectares of farmland and over 3 000 hectares of aquaculture. Almost 2 000 cattle and over 20 000 poultry were lost. Several people were killed and over 60 were injured. In addition, the typhoon caused significant damages to infrastructure, dams and irrigation systems. Despite the typhoon’s impact, the anticipatory action taken still prevented a much worse scenario. FAO hopes that the success of the preventative measures ahead of disasters like Typhoon Noru will help promote a shift in policy and a full integration of anticipatory action into the national disaster management plans of Viet Nam and other countries worldwide.

      "article_text": "New “smart” farming techniques and technologies, like drip irrigation and pest traps, are helping farmers in Uzbekistan revolutionize their greenhouses, save water and increase their crop yields and incomes. ©FAO/Guzal Fayzieva Large, flavorful tomatoes ripen in Odina Sattorova’s backyard greenhouse in Uzbekistan’s Ferghana Valley. Their perfect shape, rich colour and smooth texture – undeniable indicators of quality – are the result of many days of intensive work in the greenhouse. Odina, who has worked in greenhouses taking care of seedlings and helping harvest grapes since she was young, was used to this kind of hard work. Her family relied on agriculture to earn their living. But this now 43-year-old woman farmer has learned that there are new “smart” farming techniques that reduce labour and markedly increase productivity and profitability. The facts speak for themselves. Today, Odina grows about 400 kilograms of tomatoes per week during the harvest season, whereas before, she hardly produced even 120 kilograms. Along with the quantity, the quality of the product has also improved. The fruits are consistently smooth, large and more flavorful than the previous ones. Odina learned to utilize these transformative techniques through the project, “Smart Farming for the Future Generation”, implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). With financial support from the Republic of Korea, this project was launched in 2021 in Uzbekistan and Viet Nam to introduce new growing methods and tools that decrease water consumption and labour, while increasing yields, crop quality and incomes. The project introduced simple innovations in water management, pest control and greenhouse improvements, such as the use of a plastic shade net, instead of the traditional clay cover, on top of the greenhouse to keep it from overheating. The new plastic film is not only more durable but it also absorbs ultraviolet radiation and prevents condensation on the inside of the greenhouse. Of all the tools introduced by the project, Odina considers the drip irrigation system the most useful and effective one. The irrigation system includes a fertilization mechanism, which allows her to provide nutrients to the crops. The system also measures the salinity and acidity of the water and, most importantly, regulates its use, saving this valuable resource. The FAO project helped farmers install a water tank and drip irrigation system that saves water, as well as farmers’ time and effort. It also reduces the prevalence of plant diseases, as water dispersal is regulated automatically. ©FAO/Guzal Fayzieva Water issues have always been crucial for Odina’s district of Uzbekistan. Being very near the border with Kyrgyzstan, this area has been highly dependent on water sources coming from this neighbouring country. Also located at an altitude of 677 metres above sea level, with steep and treeless terrains, digging wells is not a reliable option, as it is often too deep and expensive to do so. In this setting, farmers used to rely on canals that brought water to the villages from the hills. Farmers would have to wait for her or his turn to use the water to irrigate their land. Now the water is collected in a special water tank and then used as necessary, with the system irrigating greenhouses automatically. The uniform water supply of the drip irrigation system maintains the required humidity of the soil and the greenhouse as a whole. This is important because when there is too much water, excessive moisture creates a favorable environment for plant diseases. “It is very convenient, saves me time and effort, and most importantly, saves water,” Odina explains of the drip irrigation system. “Before, I did not know how important it is to keep a constant record of temperature and humidity inside the greenhouse. I did not know how to prevent the spread of various plant diseases, due to which we used to lose a significant part of the crop. I learned these and other useful things during the FAO trainings,” she says. With these new skills and practices, Odina has grown her tomato business into a thriving small enterprise and receives two to three times her previous income. New methods for green growth Neighbours and guests who visit Odina’s farm immediately notice the improvements to the greenhouse, including the insect-proof mesh that covers all openings, the disinfectant foot mat at the entrance and the sticky traps for pests, all of which contribute to minimizing the use of pesticides. “It is easier to prevent pests and diseases from entering the greenhouse than to deal with them later,” says Luciano Rovesti, FAO Expert on Integrated Pest Management. “These are simple but important technological innovations that will greatly aid in reducing the incidence of pests, in the same way that the adoption of drip irrigation reduces the incidence of plant diseases.” Digitalization is another important aspect of greenhouse management. The project is testing equipping greenhouses with sensors and software for measuring soil moisture, solar radiation, humidity and air temperature. This data is then displayed on the farmers' mobile devices and allows them to remotely control the microclimate in greenhouses and irrigate in a timely manner. The FAO project plans to increase the number of “smart” greenhouses in Uzbekistan. ©FAO/Guzal Fayzieva For Odina’s family, the additional revenue from her flourishing backyard greenhouse is more than welcome. Odina, who has worked at home all her life, now wants to provide her daughters with the opportunities that come with higher education. She is saving the money she earns to pay for her daughters’ university fees. One is studying to be a doctor and the other to be a teacher – while her youngest daughter is preparing to enter university. Odina's is one of 40 greenhouses that FAO has modernized in the Andijan, Namangan and Ferghana regions of Uzbekistan. When farming becomes \"smart\" and incomes become sustainable, confidence in the future increases. This year the project aims to increase the number of optimized greenhouses and extend these sustainable practices even further. Every 16 October - World Food Day - is a chance to celebrate food heroes around the world. From farmers and fishers to innovators and chefs, food heroes are leading local and global efforts to create more sustainable and resilient agrifood systems. But we can all be food heroes: respect food, eliminate waste, reduce unnecessary consumption. Our actions are our future. Let’s build a better one together. Learn more"

      "article_text": "Fadmee and fellow fish processors are using a new type of oven and better techniques for smoking fish as part of an FAO project to improve food and income security after years of conflict in the Far North region of Cameroon. ©FAO Sitting on the Logone River in the Far North region of Cameroon, right on the border of Chad, Logone-Birni has experienced more than its share of conflict and upheaval. The Boko Haram insurgency, which has been affecting the Far North region for nearly a decade, has meant that many have suffered violence and disruption. But in December 2021, violent clashes erupted once again. This time the conflict arose between inland fishers, ethnic herders and farmers over limited water resources, a result of climate change and declining rainfall. Tens of thousands of people were forced to flee for their lives. For years, fishers, herders and farmers have relied on the same river and other inland water bodies for their livelihoods. But conflict over these increasingly scarce water resources has forced fish processor, Fadmee, and many others to leave their homes. Fadmee recalls, \"I lost everything: my activities, my equipment for smoking fish which I had to sell. Everything was destroyed, even my house.’’ Despite her personal losses, when the conflict died down a couple of months later, Fadmee was relieved to return to her hometown of Honkol in early 2022. She joined many others who were looking to rebuild their lives and livelihoods. Supporting the reintegration and economic recovery of Internally Displaced Persons (IDPs), the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) provided 18 Chorkor fish smoking ovens and capacity training in sustainable fish smoking methods to fishers in several villages of Logone-Birni. Economically, Chorkor fish smoking ovens boost production of smoked fish, increasing incomes. Ecologically, these ovens emit little smoke and require less wood for fuel consumption. ©FAO Better quality, fewer losses With FAO’s support, 60 women and 26 men were trained in the construction and operation of the Chorkor ovens and acquired improved smoking techniques. These trained women and men then organized sessions in their villages to share the best practices they had learned. In this region, like many others in Africa, hot smoking has been the traditional method of processing fresh fish for sale. The introduction of ovens, such as the Chorkor, enhances the quality of finished products. With up to 24 drying racks, these ovens also have the capacity to boost production of smoked fish and reduce food losses, which ultimately means greater incomes for fishers like Fadmee. From an environmental point of view, the Chorkor oven requires less wood for fuel consumption, reducing pressure on natural resources; it also emits little smoke, which minimizes the health risks associated with smoke inhalation, burns and heat exposure. There are also social benefits. The FAO project has given IDPs and host communities a chance to work together. Linked to the installation of the ovens, 18 groups were established to collaborate on these activities, all the while promoting peaceful coexistence and strengthening social inclusion. FAO has trained 60 women and 26 men in using Chorkor ovens to smoke fish, improving the quality of their products as well as their incomes. ©FAO Fadmee says her work is now less labour intensive, and she produces better quality smoked fish. \"Before FAO introduced the Chorkor, I used traditional ovens, and it was difficult for me. This new smoking method is very good because it allows me to handle fish easily, and I spend much less time and effort,\" she says. \"Today, I manage to smoke fish up to four times a week, and my profits help me meet my family's needs.\" Fadmee continues, \"I plan to increase my smoking production and build another Chorkor oven.” As part of this project, FAO also distributed fishing inputs to 127 households, a total of nearly 900 people. “We wish to support the development of responsible fishing and the reduction of post-harvest losses in the areas bordering the Logone River, hence the need to set up Chorkor ovens in the other villages of Logone-Birni and the surrounding municipalities,” says Athman Mravili, FAO Representative in Cameroon. “Internally Displaced Persons, returnees and host communities need our support to regain their footing.” Conflict and climate-induced crises and the displacement they create are a major cause of malnutrition and food insecurity worldwide. Together with its partners, FAO is working to reduce these impacts by supporting the food security and livelihoods of those affected. Learn more"

An enabling environment for grass charcoal Currently, grass charcoal production, at GHS 100 (USD 10) per 100 kilograms, is about twice as expensive as wood charcoal, mainly owing to the additional components required, such as a binding agent.",
      "article_text": "Ghanaian women turn to a revolutionary way of producing charcoal using harvested savannah grasses. ©MITDS “The idea of grass charcoal had never crossed my mind!” exclaims Mary Tiekor, Handi Women’s Group member and charcoal producer, as she holds a freshly made organic briquette in her hands. “And yet, here it is – and the process is so quick!” Like Mary, over six million people in Ghana's savannah ecological zone depend on wood fuel and tree charcoal for daily use, and this represents just a fraction of the more than 2.4 billion people worldwide that rely on firewood and charcoal for cooking, energy and income. Unsustainable practices in charcoal production have led to deforestation and degradation of the country’s environment and continue to do so. These environmental challenges are compounded by Ghana’s severe dry season, during which the abundant savannah grass often fuels the characteristic wildfires of those months. The fires can decimate crops and consequently threaten food security. Now, savannah grass can be used to fuel stoves thanks to a new charcoal production method developed and piloted as part of an initiative by the Millar Institute for Transdisciplinary and Development Studies (MITDS), with financial and technical support from the Forest and Farm Facility (FFF) of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO). The new production method aims to capitalize on the potential of the region's grasses, helping reduce fire risk and forest degradation while contributing to ecological, economic and social goals. \"We have plenty of grass everywhere, but we never knew that it could be useful or help us alleviate poverty,\" says Biirbarimah Inuur, a 40-year-old charcoal producer from Naafaa community in the Sawla-Tuna-Kalba district of Ghana’s Savannah region. The grass charcoal is heated and mashed together before adding a binding agent to form the briquette. ©MITDS From grass to charcoal Whereas traditional charcoal is produced with biomass harvested from trees, the grass briquettes use harvested grass and a binding agent to create small bricks of charcoal. The process is less labour-intensive and the bricks easier to produce. This technology has created a market for green cooking fuel, incentivizing people to protect the grass and the land. Additionally, every 100 kilograms of grass charcoal consumed saves two trees, which can net 76 kilograms of carbon credits a year. According to MITDS, widespread use of grass charcoal could offset over 44 000 tons of carbon a year with a potential estimated income of GHS 4.4 million (USD 400 000) in carbon offset credits. MITDS has piloted the production and use of grass briquettes across five forest and farm producer organizations. FFF additionally provided support for training these producer organizations and facilitated market access and development. Over 95 percent of those involved reported that they felt the new grass briquettes were a good business opportunity. \"It [the grass charcoal] burns slower, and since we women like our food to simmer when cooking, grass charcoal is the right charcoal for us,\" says Biirbarimah Inuur. The new grass charcoal capitalizes on the region's savannah grasses, helping reduce fire risk and forest degradation. ©MITDS Training local communities Local women have been at the centre of the training supported by FFF, MITDS and other regional partners, making up 234 of the 448 people trained. They have learnt how to harvest the grass sustainably, produce the grass briquettes and market their surplus for commercial sale. \"I now prepare my own grass charcoal for cooking. It saves me a lot of money,\" says 71-year-old Mary Stella Poerekuu, a retired teacher from Lyssah in the Lawra municipality of the Upper West region. Local entrepreneurs are now exploring ways to establish more grass charcoal businesses, following the success of pilot businesses in two communities in the Savannah and Upper West regions. The lessons learned from these businesses will be used to upscale the approach across the country. To improve the marketability of the grass charcoal, FFF and MITDS are also developing grass paper that can be used as packaging for the grass briquettes. This will enable producers to sell their charcoal at higher prices and improve the recognition of the product. The paper has also been identified as a potential material to improve roofing in rural housing, acting as insulation to cool the houses in the hot, dry season and reducing pressure on forest resources used to produce plywood. An enabling environment for grass charcoal Currently, grass charcoal production, at GHS 100 (USD 10) per 100 kilograms, is about twice as expensive as wood charcoal, mainly owing to the additional components required, such as a binding agent. “The grass used for charcoal is also purchased from communities; whereas felling a tree in the forest is considered ‘free’,” explains FAO Forestry Officer, Sophie Grouwels, the FFF country coach. “However, FFF is supporting MITDS in bringing together green energy experts and policymakers to find ways to enhance the enabling environment for grass charcoal and make it more attractive for communities.” One proposed solution is to introduce government incentives to propel its use. A similar approach was used with great success in the country when gas stoves were first introduced as an alternative to wood charcoal stoves. Policymakers are expressing their support for the new technology as an opportunity to protect forest landscapes while strengthening local livelihoods. Following a ban on tree felling for timber production, Edward Ndanbbon Taalak, Nabdam District Coordinator of Ghana’s National Disaster Management Organisation in the Upper East region, was approached by a group of women asking what they would use to cook food for their families. “I had no answer,” said Taalak. \"But now I do. When I return, I will tell them, 'You can continue to produce charcoal to take care of your families. But this time, you will be producing charcoal from grass, which is more abundant here than trees!'.\" Learn more"

Before that we were forced to take loans that were difficult to repay.\" In total, the initiative created 16 savings and credit groups for women, for which FAO also provided an expert to support the groups and equipment such as calculators, savings books and safes to keep the associations’ cash. The FAO project in southeastern Haiti empowers rural women by helping them invest in their own agribusinesses. ©FAO Yolande has trodden a path different from many other village women. She manages a bakery that supplies customers well beyond the boundaries of Mapou in addition to overseeing her farm. She is responsible for about 20 employees who work on her land and take care of livestock for the benefit of a salary. She has the income she needs to support herself and her family. But she too has encountered significant difficulties due to the current crisis of violence in the country. She used to travel to the capital, Port-au-Prince, to get supplies, but now prefers to give money to drivers to buy what she needs because, she says, \"I was assaulted several times while going to buy goods.\" A role model for many women in her community and beyond, she still is very attached to her roots in Mapou and would rather live there than anywhere else. Yolande is also the coordinator of the women's association \"Organization of Women Advisors, or O ganizasyon Fanm Konsekan Mapou in Creole, which owns a corn mill that was provided by the FAO project and serves the locality. Before the community received it, local people, especially women, would travel to a mill located near the border with the Dominican Republic to process maize, but sometimes they would return empty-handed due to delays or breakdowns along the route or overcrowding at the mill itself. The local corn mill has solved this issue. The village savings and loan association provides money to women for anything from children’s school fees to starting businesses or putting food on the table during holiday periods. ©FAO It’s clear that the initiative “has played an important role in reducing the inequalities that women face and putting them in a stronger position to contribute to the development of their communities,” says FAO Representative in Haiti, Jose Luis Fernandez. The needs remain significant, yet women investing in themselves is a small but significant step to transforming their own lives, that of their families and of society in general. Learn more"

      "article_text": "Innovation doesn’t need to be complicated. Rural communities in Haiti are finding new ways of minimizing crop losses and increasing income by implementing simple water management techniques. ©FAO Derniella Noel was hoping that, this year, she could produce enough fruits and vegetables on her land in Maïssade, a commune in central Haiti, to make a decent income and feed her family of five. But again this year, it wasn’t possible. So, she decided to take on work as a veterinary officer and a teacher as well. Over the past few years, Derniella, a 49-year-old mother and lifetime smallholder farmer, has seen the climate change significantly. Combined with recurrent natural disasters like hurricanes, floods and drought, farming no longer generates adequate income for her family. Haiti has been increasingly battered by natural disasters and the effects of climate change on this island are blatant. Rural communities have had to deal with high risk of crop losses and the lack of resources to cope with climate variability. Like Derniella, many farmers have been forced to diversify their activities and find alternative sources of income to support their families. Water management has been of particular concern. With less rain than in past years, farmers have been needing to find other ways to irrigate their crops. This has been one of the main issues the Strengthening Agricultural Adaptation (SAGA) project, implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), has been helping farmers navigate. “Climate change affects us enormously. It becomes more difficult for us to cultivate our gardens because of the lack of proximity to water. To water our plots, we have to walk for up to an hour to reach the river and draw water from it,” Derniella said. As one effective solution, the SAGA project, funded by the Government of Quebec, helped farmers implement a drip system using plastic barrels, known as “drums”. One or more barrels are placed at an elevated location and connected to hoses or pipes that distribute water to the crops below. Each drum holds 208 litres of water, and farmers can be easily construct and maintain them with limited resources. This system is a low-cost and simple method of irrigating small plots. “Once we had filled the plastic barrels, we could spend several days without going to the river to draw water,” Derniella said. The project is helping Derniella Noel (left), Tilus Baudelaire (right) and other Haitian farmers come up with new ways of storing water and irrigating fields. ©FAO For smallholder farmers who rely on agriculture for their livelihoods and represent the majority of Haiti’s rural population, solutions like this are key. “We have been experiencing the effects of climate change for several years,” said 38-year-old Tilus Baudelaire. He too has seen his production decline over the past few years. “The rainy season has become very irregular. For those of us who practice market gardening, this disrupts our activity a lot because market gardening can’t be adapted to rainfall patterns but depends on regular irrigation either using pumps or using the drip system with plastic barrels,” he said. In Haiti, SAGA has been working with partners on the ground including the Centre for International Studies and Cooperation ( Centre d’étude et de cooperation international - CECI) to help farmers adapt to climate change, extreme weather events and market fluctuations. Through farmer field school groups, farmers are learning how to implement integrated water management techniques and use cropping calendars so that production can continue even when the rains fail or drought ensues. They are also learning practical business and marketing approaches, such as pooling resources to purchase agricultural inputs and services and conducting group sales of harvested products. Tilus describes, “Through the SAGA project, we learned several techniques during our training sessions, including effective water management to avoid [water] waste.” “We also learned how to prepare the ground. We cannot practice watering just any old way. The drip system through plastic barrels, introduced last year, is better suited to small plots of land.” This drip watering system pushed up yields by about 50 percent when compared to other water supply methods. For Derniella, higher yields on her farm have boosted her income, and she is more independent and better able to provide for her family. Eventually, she hopes she can focus on agriculture without having to work many jobs at the same time. “The SAGA project has been very good for us. We will continue to share this knowledge in all the farmer field schools of our community to help better manage market gardens and produce vegetables for sale but also for family food.” The use of new techniques and cropping calendars are helping farming communities adapt to climate change while stabilizing income from farming. ©FAO Tilus, too, no longer depends only on the rainfall for water for his land thanks to the techniques he learned during his training. “Before we worked in a conventional way. Now we know how to treat the soil, treat diseased plants, when and how to spray our gardens. When we work with precise techniques, we use fewer resources. So, the project has helped us by providing technical knowledge on sustainable practices in agriculture,” Tilus said. SAGA's focus on smallholder farmers, with a particular focus on women and youth, and community-based approaches in Haiti are crucial not only for the food security and livelihoods of the rural population but also for the resilience and sustainability of the whole agrifood system in the country. With the support of the Government of Quebec, SAGA has been working since 2018, helping communities build their resilience and capacity to adapt to climate change in Haiti and Senegal. This year, the project is being extended to Côte d’Ivoire. Learn more"

      "article_text": "Betty Ocira Acayo, a refugee from South Sudan, celebrates not the fruits but the vegetables of her labor – local greens she learned how to grow through an FAO project in Kiryandongo Refugee Settlement in northern Uganda. ©FAO/Vincent Tremeau When Betty Ocira Acayo arrived in northern Uganda with her five children, her first concern was where she and her family would live – followed closely by how she would feed them. Betty’s family crossed the border in 2016, alongside over 500 000 other people, mostly women and children, fleeing violent conflict in South Sudan. The Government of Uganda welcomed families like Betty’s, providing a home for her family in Kiryandongo Refugee Settlement and a 40x40 metre plot of land for her to farm. While Betty had some experience of kitchen gardening, many refugees from South Sudan arriving in Uganda had primarily been livestock keepers, with limited experience of farming. Many of the 1.5 million refugees in Uganda are in the same situation as Betty – they have been displaced outside of their country for longer than five years, and they don’t know when it will be safe for them to return home. Despite the inclusive policies that grant refugees land for farming as well as the right to work and move freely in Uganda, a lack of economic opportunities means that more than half of refugees continue to rely on emergency distributions of food and cash to meet their basic needs. Over 90 percent of refugees are highly economically vulnerable, with more than one third experiencing food insecurity. Refugees have long said that relying on emergency assistance is not a long-term solution. They wish to become self-reliant and simply need the tools and skills to do so. In that light, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) invests in self-reliance for the benefit of everyone – from the country and communities that host refugees, who are often themselves food insecure, to the refugees, who can build skills to support their livelihoods in their place of displacement or back home, should it become safe to return there. The FAO project offers training and agricultural tools to help build sustainable livelihoods for both refugees and host communities. ©FAO/Vincent Tremeau Betty was invited to join FAO’s Refugee Agricultural Value Chains for Economic Self Reliance project. Funded by the IKEA Foundation, the project’s goal is to build sustainable livelihoods for both refugees living in the Kiryandongo settlement and Ugandans living in the neighboring communities around it. Through the project, Betty joined an FAO-implemented Farmer Field School where, by working on an experimental garden side-by-side with other refugees and Ugandans, she learned effective agricultural techniques, including vertical gardening, to maximize the space in her plot. She also learned irrigation techniques that require less water, an important consideration in water-scarce Kiryandongo. Participants were also provided with chickens and taught to keep them. The eggs served as a needed source of protein or income for many families. In addition to crops for her family’s consumption, Betty and the other Farmer Field School participants were given seeds and learned how to grow passion fruit specifically to sell. In South Sudan, Betty had only grown crops for her family to eat. In contrast, the Farmer Field School in Kiryandongo promoted building skills related to business development, marketing and financial literacy. This helped Betty and the other farmers in her group formalize and register with the district local government, which opens up access to additional financing, including government grants. They have also formed a savings group that allows members to put away money collectively and lend to members for emergencies or for investment back into their agricultural businesses. For Betty and the other women who make up 70 percent of participants, the project has been transformative. When Betty’s husband died in South Sudan, her family lost their breadwinner. Now she has taken on that role, selling passion fruit, eggplant and other vegetables in the local market, keeping money aside for emergencies and using the rest to feed her children. “I realize that the skills I have gained have changed my life,” says Betty. She even shares these new skills with others in the settlement: “Many others come to learn from me.” In FAO’s Farmer Field School, refugees and members of the host community learned techniques to keep crops healthy. Beyond self-reliance, the project is also contributing to the peaceful coexistence of refugees and their host communities. ©FAO/Vincent Tremeau The passion fruit crop has proven popular in the local market, and if in the future the new farmers scale up production, FAO will be able to connect them to larger buyers from the capital who can buy the fruit in bulk. This will further increase the sustainability of the passion fruit value chain in Uganda and improve the economic outcomes for farmers. In the meantime, beyond self-reliance, the project is also contributing to the peaceful coexistence of refugees and their host communities. It is not uncommon for tensions to arise between refugees and local communities, especially over access to natural resources like water and trees and an imbalance in humanitarian and development assistance between the groups. FAO is working with the Government of Uganda to address the root causes of these tensions by creating sustainable forestry management plans and promoting the use of alternative energy sources. Meanwhile, the project is also helping to improve the relationship between the groups, specifically by including host communities in all of the project activities and creating mixed Farmer Field School groups of Ugandans and refugees so that they can learn new skills from each other and collaborate towards a common goal. In the course of growing and selling produce, host community members and refugees work together in mutually beneficially ways, and the overall improvement in financial security for both groups has helped to alleviate tensions. As the number of refugees living globally approaches 37 million and the average length of time that a refugee is displaced is 20 years, governments need new strategies to ensure refugees are living dignified lives, not stuck in limbo without the prospect of a long-term solution. In Kiryandongo and in refugee settlements worldwide, there is a huge opportunity to unlock the full potential of agriculture to help people address their own needs and improve their lives.

      "article_text": "mail live_help The first edition of an accelerator programme for women-led SMEs aims to empower female entrepreneurs to use agrifood systems to reduce poverty and achieve Zero Hunger While small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in the food and agriculture sectors play an outsized role in guaranteeing food security, particularly for the poorest and most vulnerable consumers, they are more likely to encounter difficulties in accessing finance to grow and run their businesses. This is especially true for women-owned businesses, which face greater difficulties in accessing credit and financial liquidity , and are more vulnerable to market shocks and disruptions. On June 8, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations and the International Agri -food Network (IAFN) celebrated the achievements of 45 women agrifood entrepreneurs from sub-Saharan Africa and recognized their successful completion of the inaugural edition of the Accelerator Mentorship Programme for Women-led Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) . The programme , a joint initiative of FAO and IAFN, aimed to empower women agrifood entrepreneurs by providing them with the knowledge and tools needed to grow their businesses and adapt to an ever-changing marketplace. Members of the first cohort represented a variety of areas of work along the agrifood value chain, from production, processing, marketing and distribution to digital solutions for agriculture and logistics , transport and supply chain services. Each participant in the programme was paired with a mentor – a leader in a field which corresponded to the participant’s area of interest and business activity – from whom they received one-on-one coaching over a six-month period. These meetings were complemented by a series of online courses, tailor-made trainings , and networking and peer-learning opportunities where all participants were able to connect with one another. Women’s empowerment not only benefits women – it is also key to the economic and social outcomes of the communities they belong to. According to the 2023 report on the Status of Women in Agrifood Systems , if half of small-scale producers benefited from development interventions that focused on empowering women, it would significantly raise the incomes of an additional 58 million people and increase the resilience of an additional 235 million people. By the same token, IAFN calculates that by investing in 45 women entrepreneurs, the accelerator programme reached around a half a million people through the work that the participants’ companies do. Both participants and mentors took the stage during the closing ceremony to share how they had used what they had learned during the programme to benefit more than just their own businesses , highlighting how investing in women is a gain for the entire community. Célia Chabi, the founder and CEO of KIEL BIEN-ÊTRE, a Beninese company which creates environmentally-friendly products from baobab leaves, explained how she uses each stage of the supply chain to improve the lives of the women with whom she works. Thanks to the coursework on nutrition which she completed during the programme, she felt she was more able to support rural women in accessing the right types of food they needed for optimal nutrition. Emmastella Gakuo, the Director of Operations at Savanna Circuit Technologies in Kenya, detailed how the programme had helped her to improve pricing models for her company’s mobile solar coolers and dehydrators, which allow smallholder farmers to reduce their post-harvest losses while cutting carbon emissions. She hoped that by offering access to production equipment without heavy up-front investment, she could help transform agriculture into a lucrative employment option for those in her area. One of the most inspiring stories came from Oluyemisi Iranloye, the founder and managing director of Psaltry International Limited (PIL) in Nigeria. She credited the mentorship she received with helping her to follow the necessary steps to set up a foundation which will support rural students who are the children of farmers. Her company, which grew from marketing cassava produce to producing food-grade starch and flour, used an inclusive business model to train subsistence farmers in cassava production and create a supply chain involving more than 10,000 farm families. Through her foundation, she will also be able to invest in future generations by supporting rural students – particularly girls - who are interested in continuing their education, especially in the areas of science and agriculture. Mentors also shared how their involvement in the programme had positively influenced their own work. Reflecting on her experience as a mentor, Jelica Kujundzic (CAFI - Commodity and Freight Integrators DMCC), described mentorship as “the transformative power of knowledge and an opportunity to shape lives and leave a legacy.” Kantha Shelke (Corvus Blue LLC / Johns Hopkins University), spoke of how her experience with the programme had inspired her to draw on her business connections to create a foundation which would allow more established agrifood businesses to share their physical and intellectual assets with those who were just starting out in the same sector. Following the success of the first edition, the partners hope to repeat the accelerator programme, offering additional women entrepreneurs a chance to improve their businesses and invest in their communities, paving the way for a true agrifood systems transformation.

      "article_text": "The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Canadian government supported 43 Indigenous Peoples communities of the Peruvian Amazon to revitalize fishing and farming initiatives and restore food and nutrition sources. ©FAO In September 1991, Rosalinda Shamayre Elias heard explosions and screams in her community. “Terrorists, terrorists!” she shouted. Her people, the Ashaninkas, a group of Indigenous Peoples that has lived for thousands of years in the rainforests of Peru and Brazil, were being ambushed by the former terrorist group, Sendero Luminoso ( The Shining Path ). That night a grenade was thrown at Rosalinda’s house. She ran away with her three children and remained hidden in the Mazamari forest for four months. Rosa— as she’s fondly known— and Hector Luna Jacopo, her husband, not only lost their home but also dozens of family members and friends during the long years of conflict. Even in the face of immense loss and heartache, Rosa and Hector found a way to persevere and heal. In the Ashaninka language, they describe this as notsimancaque , a term that signifies “resilience”, or more accurately, the ability to mend the soul and carry on for the betterment of the community. The Ashaninka Indigenous Peoples in Peru relied on “notsimancaque”, a term that signifies resilience, during years of conflict, and more recently, during the COVID-19 pandemic. ©FAO Two decades later they found themselves again amidst fear, loss and uncertainty. It was 15 March 2020, and the Peruvian authorities announced a lockdown due to the spread of the COVID-19 virus— at the time, a new and unknown illness. Their community, called El Milagro, had a reason to be fearful. They had a health centre, but no doctors, medical supplies or medicines. At first, the Ashaninka people took measures to protect themselves from the virus by closing off their territory to outsiders and isolating themselves. But as time wore on, the community found themselves struggling with hunger and dwindling supplies. To address the growing food scarcity, they designated a group to venture out and trade for supplies. Unfortunately, it wasn't long before COVID-19 began to infiltrate their community, and many fell ill. \"Many of our brothers and sisters got sick, and some didn't make it,\" Rosa and Hector recounted. Regaining a lost opportunity The pandemic also took from them what had recently become an opportunity to improve nutrition and livelihoods in the community. Back in 2018, local authorities had supported 18 families in El Milagro to install fish farms and raise fingerlings. The Indigenous Peoples group hoped to improve and prevent children’s malnutrition, which in the Amazonian communities sometimes reaches up to 20.3 percent, according to government figures. The arrival of the pandemic abruptly ended the initiative. As the health situation improved at the end of 2021, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) with the support of the Government of Canada conducted rapid food and local market’s assessments to strengthen rural and agricultural community-based organizations. The initiative aimed to improve nutrition and livelihoods while also focusing on empowering Indigenous Women and supporting gender-responsive public protection programmes. FAO visited El Milagro, where the community expressed clearly the need of restarting and expanding the fish farming project the pandemic had taken from them. Rosa assumed the leadership of this initiative. Her job was to coordinate workflows and promote the participation of more women to raise fingerlings. “We learned how to prepare the fish feed, how to improve water circulation and how to organize ourselves better,” she explains, adding that the fish has also helped improve her people’s nutrition. \"I dream of a community where malnutrition is a thing of the past, and women can weave and laugh without fear,\" she shares. With the support of FAO and the Government of Canada, El Milagro and 42 other communities across the provinces of Atalaya in the region of Ucayali and Satipo were able to revive their fish farming and other agricultural projects, including growing crops like coffee and cocoa. Indigenous families of El Milagro feed their children with pacu fish, a variety native to the Amazon River. These fish are considered ideal to farm for their tolerance to the low levels of oxygen found in farming ponds. ©FAO Women spearheading resilience Rosa recognizes that empowering women is key to ensuring a better future for her children and the community. Together with other women from her community, Rosa received weekly FAO training not only on better aquaculture techniques but also on leadership, women’s rights and human rights. In addition to boosting productivity, these training sessions also focused on empowering the women of the community, many of whom live in extreme poverty, with some surviving on less than USD 1.90 per day, according to the International Labour Organization. Rosa acknowledges that being a mother and a leader is complicated and that the main limitation for some women is obtaining the support of their husbands, which is thankfully not her situation. From serving as the head of the community kitchen to taking on the role of treasurer on the community board, Rosa has been a capable and dynamic leader, and her husband supports her involvement. She would like to eventually lead El Milagro, and they work together to make that a reality. Overall in 2022, as part of the COVID-19 Response and Recovery Programme , FAO and Canada supported over 23 000 smallholder farmers, especially youth and Indigenous Peoples in Peru, Bolivia, Nicaragua and Honduras. On the verge of 60, Rosa’s resilience remains unwavering. Having endured the horrors of conflict, illness and poverty, she has learned to seize every opportunity that life presents her, including FAO’s initiative, to heal, to start over, to notsimancaque .

For local communities in these project areas, forests are the main source of income, and their degradation is a serious threat to their livelihoods. FAO has been conducting training activities for these communities to diversify their income-generation opportunities. While rural women in Uzbekistan have high levels of education and participate in economic activities, they are almost completely uninvolved in forestry decision-making and have limited access to information and property. Therefore, the trainings have focused on women, especially those from poor households."

      "article_text": "Colombian women fish vendors, called Platoneras, have a rich history and an important role in society, providing nutritious food from the sea for the community. So important is their role that it is celebrated with a national day held every year in December. ©ConectadosColombia It’s early morning in the coastal town of Buenaventura. As the sun rises over one of Colombia’s busiest ports, the rhythmic sound of Chonta Marimba music is heard on the streets as fishers and fish workers make their way to work. Sandra Gómez Montaño, a 55-year-old fish processor, is one of the town’s 400 000 inhabitants, and like the majority of the population, she depends on fisheries for her livelihood. Every day, she buys freshly caught fish from women known as the Platoneras because they traditionally carried large plates, or Platones , on their heads. This Afro-Colombian tradition is passed down from generation to generation, and these women fish vendors are proud of their heritage and role in society. “The Platoneras play a very important role,” says Sandra, who works closely with the women fish vendors and turns this fresh catch into nutritious products for the community. Both the Platoneras and women fish processors are a crucial link between locally produced seafood and communities, providing essential nutrition for local families. Working in the fish sector is embedded in Sandra’s heritage since her mother was a Platonera . However, she recognises that there are significant challenges in this field: incomes for women fish workers are typically very low and can vary greatly from month to month. And while the women fish workers have access to public health care, they are among an estimated 70 percent of Colombia’s workers excluded from social protection programmes. Too often they miss out on retirement pensions and unemployment benefits, leaving them more vulnerable to livelihood and food insecurity. Now through its SOCPRO4FISH project, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Colombian Marine and Coastal Research Institute (INVEMAR), with funding from the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (NORAD), are working to improve the Platoneras ’ business skills and raise their incomes, as well as enhance their access to social protection schemes. Though women fish workers are an important part of the value chain, they are among the estimated 70 percent of Colombia’s workers excluded from social protection programmes, leaving them more vulnerable to livelihood and food insecurity. ©FAO “SOCPRO4FISH aims to promote economic inclusion and strengthen the resilience and livelihood security of fishers and fish workers to shocks and impacts,” says Heysel Calderón, FAO’s National Coordinator for SOCPRO4FISH. “It is very important to understand that social protection is an effective measure for reducing poverty and food insecurity, as well as a mechanism for promoting rural development and sustainable fisheries management.” Around 100 Platoneras and women fish workers have so far taken part in the training, which has also raised awareness about the public pension schemes and helped workers get in touch with officials to access social programmes offered by the Government of Colombia. Social protection is essential for inclusive, sustainable growth and eliminating poverty. Yet, more than half of the world’s population, and particularly women, are excluded from social protection, according to the International Labour Organization. On average, women have social protection coverage which is eight percent lower than men. In Colombia, the government has attempted to fill the gap with non-contributory benefits, but the coverage and benefit levels remain low. The situation is even worse in the fisheries sector, as most programmes do not recognize the realities on the ground and, in many circumstances, are not flexible enough to meet the sector’s needs. Small-scale fishing activities often involve high levels of informality, irregularity and seasonality, which can result in the exclusion of small-scale fishers from laws governing formal employment, therefore hindering their participation in national social protection systems. “In order to change this scenario, more projects need to focus on the expansion of social protection programmes, including shock-responsive and gender-sensitive social protection for fishers and fish workers,” says Daniela Kalikoski, FAO’s Lead Technical Officer for the SOCPRO4FISH initiative. Social protection is essential for inclusive, sustainable growth and eliminating poverty. Through its SOCPRO4FISH project, FAO and its partners are working to improve fish workers’ business skills, as well as enhance their access to social protection schemes. ©FAO In Colombia, FAO and its partners have created an Inter-institutional Group on Social Protection for the Fisheries and Aquaculture Sector, called GIPRO. The group brings together government representatives, the private and public sectors, fishers and fish workers to promote dialogue and concrete action to improve access to social protection programmes. If women fish workers gain more income security and greater access to public health care, they can advance their business and plan for their future. “Now we feel supported, we have this social safety net that opens many opportunities,” Sandra says. “We can talk of our work with dignity. So, I say that now I can do many things.” Learn more"

      "article_text": "Communities in southern Somalia have had to cope with increasing scarcity of natural resources. This combined with a lack of basic services has compounded levels of need and increased the likelihood of conflicts. ©FAO A short yet perilous seven-kilometre road connects the towns of Buufow and Shalanbood in southern Somalia. The once prosperous agricultural area that produced fruits and vegetables for the region has experienced decades of conflict and destabilization. Just like most parts of the country, the region is severely affected by the ongoing drought. The two communities have had to cope with increasing scarcity of natural resources from which to derive their livelihoods. This combined with a lack of basic services and limited external assistance compounds their levels of need and increases the likelihood of conflicts. Quresho Abdirizak, a youth leader who grew up in Shalanbood, has seen firsthand the intercommunal conflict that has frayed the social strands once tying the communities together. Conflicts over water resources, irrigation canals and access to farming areas have been driving a wedge between the two neighbouring communities. “Two children from the different villages might grow up playing football together, but then due to the situation, as adults they would clash,” said Quresho. She’s part of a movement of young women and men from Buufow and Shalanbood who share a joint goal of a peaceful and food secure future. So in an original approach to conflict resolution, Quresho and other youth met for a “Game Day” , where they use a smartphone game application to identify priorities for investments in critical infrastructure that would promote peace and productivity. In this region of Somalia concrete solutions are key. A working footbridge can bring about peace; an impassable river can create divisions. The Game Day event was part of an innovative peacebuilding project implemented by the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the International Organization for Migration (IOM), in partnership with the South West State government in Somalia and funded by the United Nations Secretary-General’s Peacebuilding Fund. Using the Play for Peace mobile application, mixed teams from communities in conflict work together to gain points. The winning team proposes which infrastructure issues are prioritized for repair by the joint FAO-IOM project. ©FAO Playing for Peace On the allocated Game Day, groups of youth from both the Shalanbood and Buufow villages were mixed to compete against each other on the “ Play for Peace ” mobile application, developed by FAO’s implementing partner, Shaqodoon. “The participants have to work together to advance – they have to talk to each other and learn things about each other. The more you talk with each other the faster you will win through collaboration,” said Ahlam Mohammed, the Technology for Development Coordinator at Shaqodoon. The aim was to encourage fun, healthy competition between mixed youth groups. “On Game Day, we worked in groups to promote interaction between communities, finding solutions to the problems of moving safely and freely between the two towns,” said Quresho. “The beauty of using games is that it brings together elements such as teamwork and competition that work well with peacebuilding. It is bringing people together for a common goal,” said Ahlam. The winning team is then able to nominate locations that would be repaired through the joint project. As water is often a source of contention between the communities, canal rehabilitation was one of the youths’ top priorities. For others, the interaction between the youth of the two communities was already a step towards a more peaceful future. “I actually got to make a lot of new friends here,” said Salado Ali, a youth leader from Buufow. “If I went to Shalanbood tomorrow, I’d meet the friends I made here, and I wouldn’t be a stranger. We exchanged numbers and got along well. We had a great day,” she said. The infrastructure repairs will be a game changer for the communities, further promoting the peace-building efforts the game started. ©FAO Empowering women to build peace Ahlam said it was uplifting to see women leading some of the groups, showing others how to play the game and making decisions. “It was really inspiring for others – particularly other young women and girls – to see women leading groups on the Game Day. It could be life changing to see that in action,” she added. Somali culture is strongly patriarchal and based on a clan system. Gender inequalities are sharp , making the country the fourth to last globally when it comes to women’s status. Women are often excluded from political decision-making, and rural women in particular have limited access to education and resources. This situation results in lower food production in rural communities. “Women in these communities have been historically disadvantaged and excluded, but they’ve also organized themselves across clan lines into groups to advocate for the needs of their families. This project leans into that new development,” said Dimah Abdulkarim, FAO’s Resilience Project Officer. “Through the Promoting Inclusive Action in Peacebuilding project, which the gamification component falls within, we want to see resource rivalry turn into peaceful joint resource sharing, with both young women and men playing a central role enhancing social cohesion,” she added. The game-changing game Dimah says the real game changer will occur when the women and youth leaders see their peacebuilding efforts translate into tangible outcomes with the infrastructure repair. “We’re now rolling out infrastructure investments with the support of the Peacebuilding Fund to implement the outcomes of the Game Day,” said Dimah. For youth leaders like Quresho and Salado, the results of participating in the Game Day are already bringing about change. The villagers are now using a connecting road that they once avoided. They take and sell produce to one another’s villages, and they are sharing a medical facility that is closer to Shalanbood. “We want to put an end to intercommunal tension and become united, facing our challenges together,” said Quresho. The game day approach has demonstrated its value in empowering young people like Quresho to be involved in community decision-making processes. These gamification tools have the potential to be employed for peacebuilding, climate smart agriculture initiatives or improving community early warning systems, across Somalia and around the world.

      "article_text": "Veterinary technician, Shorena Jambazishvili, uploads the data of vaccinated animals into Georgia’s National Animal Identification and Traceability System, implemented with the technical assistance of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO). ©FAO/David Khelashvili In February, when the streets of Sachkhere, Georgia are covered with snow and temperatures reach -2 degrees Celsius outside, 39-year-old Shorena Jambazishvili collects her plastic gloves, new syringes, some medicines and a smartphone and makes her way to the farm. It’s early morning, and it is time for the first round of vaccinations. Shorena, as a veterinary technician, works alongside the veterinarian to vaccinate all the cows in the municipality and then digitalize the information. In the team of two, she is responsible for inputting all data into Georgia’s online National Animal Identification and Traceability System (NAITS), which has revolutionized the country’s animal traceability scheme in the past five years. Implemented by the Government of Georgia, with the technical assistance of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), NAITS records the data of all livestock that must be registered by law, their keepers and keeping locations. Tracing animals and animal-origin products in a prompt and timely manner through NAITS is an integral part of the food safety chain. By registering and verifying the origin and health of the animals at every step of the value chain, NAITS ensures the delivery of safe food from farm to table. Birth, origin, vaccination status, health condition and even colour of the animals are now easily searchable online. The information helps buyers to make informed and healthy choices when selecting meat and other animal-origin products. For example, customers can find QR codes on the product that link to NAITS where they can look up the origin, age and other basic information related to the product they are about to buy. Currently, NAITS holds information about more than one million bovines, thanks in large part to the veterinarians and technicians who are the pillars of the project, working in the field to collect and record the data. “When it’s the vaccinating season, you can’t miss the day and dose, so we go to the farms every day early in the mornings and late in the evenings,” says Shorena. With a syringe in one hand and a smartphone in another, she walks across the queue of a few hundred cows, some of which greet her, mooing, while others clumsily rub their foreheads against the wooden fence to scratch their giant heads. She chooses the bovine ready for the vaccine and smiles saying, “My family members find it difficult to have me out of the home so often, however… because they are not used to it.’’ Women veterinary technicians vaccinate the animals and digitalize the information as part of Georgia’s traceability system, NAITS, implemented with the help of FAO. ©FAO/David Khelashvili A new profession It was three years ago when Shorena decided to change her everyday routine of working as a housewife and learn a new profession. She decided to take courses to become a certified veterinary technician. Shorena and her husband, Arsen, who is also a veterinarian, have two children: Otar, 15 and Mariam, 13. Shorena recalls that some changes in the family’s routines were challenging for Otar and Mariam because they were used to having their mother around all the time. However, her new job promised them other benefits. “Of course, it has improved my financial situation,” Shorena explained, adding, “But even more importantly, I learn from this experience. Every day I explore something new. I educate myself in veterinary science, in various illnesses of the animals, and it keeps me growing.’’ “The more education a woman gets, the more independent she is... Independence is crucial,” she states. What’s more, this new education was also fun. Shorena and her colleagues particularly enjoyed working with technologies, such as computers, tablets and smartphones. “We collect and digitalize information including identification number of the bovine owners, the name of the farm and other information – we fill in the data through the cows’ tag numbers. Then we add the information about vaccines,’’ Shorena explains excitedly and highlights that the technological part of her job has been especially interesting. This opportunity was also transformative for Shorena’s colleague, Tea Kvatadze, another woman veterinary technician in Sachkhere: “Dealing with new technologies was easy for us, and … brought us professional development. They [the new technologies] make our job look to the future, compared to the times when we had been doing the same with papers,’’ Tea said, adding, “It has changed my life. The job is more enjoyable when you love what you do.’’ In 2022, 10 798 livestock were recorded in the municipality of Sachkhere with help of Shorena, Tea and their colleagues. Marina Macharashvili, Regional Senior Inspector at the National Food Agency in Imereti, western Georgia, stated, “They work very actively; it is hard work I don’t want to sound biased; however, I want to mention that the women were particularly fast to learn the computer, to surf through the NAITS with smartphones.’’ Three years ago, Shorena Jambazishvili became a veterinary technician and wholeheartedly believes that the more education a woman gets, the more independent she is. ©FAO/David Khelashvili The National Traceability System Local farmer, Ramaz Mghebrishvili, who runs a big farm of more than hundred cows, underlines how the veterinarians and technicians behind NAITS have made farmers' lives easier: “I am thankful the veterinarians and technicians are by our side when needed… Now it is not a big deal if you lose the cow in the mountains because you know the tag number and you can find them easily,’’ Ramaz said. With the support of the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation and the Austrian Development Cooperation, FAO and Georgia’s National Food Agency implemented this traceability project, making Georgia the first country in the region to introduce an animal identification and registration system. Several states, including North Macedonia, Albania, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and countries in the Caribbean, have expressed interest in sharing the electronic system or system development experiences. Spreading NAITS best practices and sharing experiences will be beneficial both for Georgia and the countries now implementing animal registration systems. In the meantime, the women veterinarians diligently do their jobs with dedication and passion, ensuring that, in the end, customers can make informed choices and that animal-origin food is safer for all.

Capuchin monkeys and parrots share the land with anteaters and sloths, while, beneath the sweet-and-salty water lie caimans, iguanas and snakes – shark sightings are not unheard of. Yet, hidden in the muddy banks of the river is a treasure trove of edible shellfish. It is for this cornucopia of molluscs that Aracelly Jiménez searches. She wades through the knee-deep water from 5 o’clock in the morning with a group made up mostly of other women from her community, all of whom hope to fill their buckets with mussels, clams and cockles. In these hot and humid conditions, Aracelly and her colleagues are constantly fending off the advances of the local mosquito population. “In spite of the long hours and hard work, our catch was not very well paid as there were many middlemen,” explains Aracelly. But, apart from the mud fishing, work around Chomes is hard to come by. As well as hunting for shellfish to sell, the women care for the mangrove forest with knowledge handed down from past generations. Left/top: ©FAO/Max Valencia. Right/bottom: ©Sector Pesquero/Luis Gamboa In 2017-2018, building on the training that they received from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), the women formed a cooperative called the CoopeMolus Chomes . The cooperative was recognized by a governmental decree in 2017. Aracelly and her 52 colleagues received access to social security, loans and new rights. The decree also gave protection to the mangrove forest. The women of the cooperative use the knowledge handed down by their parents and grandparents to maintain this unique habitat. They encourage the growth of new trees, clean the sandy areas beneath the twisted roots and prevent further destruction of the forest. The importance of dense mangrove thickets to our planet’s health cannot be underestimated. These ecosystems remove carbon from the oceans and the atmosphere and store it in the plants and sediment of the estuary, where the shellfish thrive. In turn, the collection of these creatures from the carbon-rich mud allows Aracelly to make a livelihood. To complement their fishing, the women sell empanadas, ceviche, fish and pre-made dishes conceived from local produce. They take orders on messenger or social media apps. “Every week each of us earns around 40 000 – 50 000 colones (around USD 75 - 90),” explains Aracelly. “These are funds that none of us had any hope of earning before. This allows us to sell our daily catch directly.” Aracelly’s endeavours allow her to pay for her son’s education and helps to provide for her family. Still, she wonders whether her earnings are enough. The women of CoopeMolus Chomes search for clams and mussels, which are then turned into meals that they then sell on digital platforms. ©FAO/Max Valencia The next step for Aracelly and her co-workers is to open a processing plant that will allow them to profit even more from their endeavours. The idea is to “commercialize the molluscs without having to depend on anyone,” she continues. “This will mean fair pay for all the hard work we do every day.” Additionally, FAO, the government and Cooperative CoopeSolidar helped the women formalize their activities and obtain a license for mollusc fishing providing them greater livelihood stability. The women have also tapped into government and international financing to invest in their businesses and have been able to access social security to improve their working conditions. “We women have changed so much,” concludes Aracelly. “Although we have many goals still to aim for, we now know we are not alone. The key is to stay united and organized.” FAO invests in local communities, providing the training and resources needed to support themselves and their families, while protecting the ecosystems vital to the health of our planet.

The wells have gone dry, and 27-year-old Pudi Soren has to travel to the riverside to grow crops, such as chickpeas and rice, that provide necessary calories and sustenance in the winter months. One crop that she can plant near her home in this season is finger millet. Finger millet doesn’t require a lot of water to grow. It needs very little fertilizer, and it is full of protein. “We have forgotten about some crops,” says Pudi. “When we were children, we saw crops such as finger millets too, but people stopped their cultivation for many years.” Over the past two decades, communities in central and eastern Indian states had largely abandoned the cultivation of oilseeds, pulses and small grains such as millets due to trends and other pressures.

Pudi recently started growing these crops again from seeds she initially received from a Benefit-sharing Fund project in India, administered by the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and implemented by the non-profit organisation, Public Advocacy Initiatives for Rights and Values in India.

These Indigenous Women belong to the Association of Women Entrepreneurs, otherwise known as “the Pioneers”. They harvest the tree’s oleoresin, collecting it from a hole drilled carefully into the trunk. They then process it into cosmetic and medicinal products, overseeing every part of the production chain. The copaiba is known as the “miracle tree” because it is one of the medicinal trees most widely used in Bolivia’s Chiquitania region – and indeed in the Amazon in general. It treats inflammation and wounds and is considered one of the most important natural remedies in a rural region where people live far from pharmacies and hospitals and have little access to public health care. The Pioneers are following in their ancestors’ footsteps. For centuries, the copaiba has been a staple of natural medicine. In Bolivia, healers used the oil, distilled from the oleoresin, to cure colds and rheumatism, massaging the pain away. Taking two drops daily mixed with a tablespoon of honey still treats bronchitis, tonsillitis and coughs here. In Brazil, they place copaiba oil on tumours and hives. A tea made from the seeds of the tree also works as a purgative and treats asthma. Learn more"

She used to bring the produce to the local market or sometimes even the one in the country’s capital, Tbilisi. Today, on top of the farm’s new additions, such as a greenhouse and modern irrigation, perhaps the most novel change is that she now sells her produce using a smartphone. For the last three years, Malika has been attending FAO trainings, which are financially supported by the European Union. These practical trainings, provided through Farmer Field Schools, teach smallholder farmers about better agricultural practices. Farmers learn by doing with practical work in demonstration plots and farms.

      "article_text": "In Saoudé’s village, social traditions dictated that women obey their husbands and the men in power. But Dimitra clubs, village dialogue groups are helping the community rethink these notions. ©FAO/ Moumouni Agali It is only recently, at age 36, that Saoudé Garba has felt in charge of her own life. Born in the village of Danje in southern Niger, she was married early to one of the three chiefs of the village. She had her first child at the age of 15, followed by eight more, without any medical assistance during her pregnancies and childbirth. As is tradition in her village, her life consisted of cooking, cleaning and doing household chores. Saoudé was financially dependent on her husband and rarely attended decision-making meetings in their village. When she did, she and other women were not allowed to speak. Social traditions of the village had always dictated that women obey their husbands and the men in power, and no one could conceive of it any other way. Saoudé and the other women in her village were not aware that they had rights, let alone that they could exercise them to improve their lives. Steps towards change In 2015, the first steps towards change were initiated when Dimitra clubs were set up in Saoudé’s village and others in the area. Dimitra clubs are voluntary discussion groups that bring women, men and young people together to bring about change in their own communities. For more than a decade, these clubs have been powerful drivers for people’s empowerment and women’s leadership in rural areas of many countries in sub-Saharan Africa. In Niger, Dimitra clubs are a central component of the Joint Programme: Accelerating Progress Towards Rural Women’s Economic Empowerment (JP RWEE), a partnership between FAO, the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), the United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and Women Empowerment (UN Women) and the United Nations World Food Programme (WFP). Supported financially by Norway and Sweden, the JP RWEE works with national and local governments, rural communities, households and individual women to tackle the deep-rooted causes of gender inequality. By enhancing rural women’s access to resources and services, including land, credit, training, information, inputs and technologies for farming, the programme strives to boost rural women’s economic empowerment and change unequal power dynamics and discriminatory gender norms. Saoudé joined a Dimitra club where women, men and even adolescent boys and girls come together to discuss common problems in their village and ways to address them. Agriculture is a common theme, but members of these clubs also discuss education, health, nutrition and women’s rights. Through dialogue and engagement, the women in the group find that they are betterable to communicate their needs and resolve issues they face. Empowered by the Dimitra club dialogues and training sessions, Saoudé soon became a leader in her own club and used this position to further women’s rights, fighting to end gender-based violence, early marriages and discrimination. ©FAO/ Moumouni Agali Leadership role Saoudé learned to read and write in the literacy centres run by FAO and UN Women. She attended Dimitra club training sessions on public speaking and gender-sensitive communication. She soon felt confident enough to speak up and lead discussions. Gradually, she rose to become a leader of her club, and in 2017 she was elected president of a network of Dimitra clubs in the commune of Djirataoua. She has built relationships with locally elected officials and religious leaders and achieved consensus on issues of common interest, using her position to fight for the economic empowerment of the women not just of her village but the region at large. Ending violence and gender bias Dimitra clubs help change the perceptions and attitudes of men and women in the community, helping them question and end gender-biased norms and laws. She realised how her own early marriage hindered her from getting an education and she didn’t want the same fate for other young girls. In other victories, she also convinced men to allow their wives to attend health centres for pre- and post-natal consultations and worked with locals to limit dowry payments so that people didn’t have to go into debt or leave the village because of them. FAO, IFAD, UN WOMEN and WFP supported the creation of savings and loans groups to support women’s economic independence, an important component of women’s empowerment. ©FAO/ Moumouni Agali Economic independence Through the JP RWEE programme, Saoudé became a farmer in her own right. Through the programme’s farming school, she learned agricultural techniques and got access to improved and climate-resilient seeds. She now grows millets, cowpea and groundnuts, and her harvests are improving each year. She keeps one third of her production for family’s consumption, sells a part and reserves the third part for processing activities. To further economically empower the women of the area, FAO, IFAD, UN WOMEN and WFP supported the creation of savings and loans groups. Thanks to these groups, the women have access to cash and credit and are learning about savings and smart utilization of collective resources. Saoudé is president of one such women's group called \"Abu Na Allah\" in the Hausa language or \"the thing of God\". This has played an important role in changing behaviour in the village. The group started with 35 women and now boasts 54 members. With the contributions collected, the women can access money to invest in their businesses. Today, Saoudé is a role model for other women, an embodiment of success as a woman leader in agriculture, entrepreneurship and empowerment. She is dedicated to sharing her experience and helping other women become aware of their rights and achieve economic independence. She hopes that in this way she can help change society and give her own children a better future. Behind all of our food, there is always someone who produced, planted, harvested, fished or transported it. In the run up to World Food Day on October 16, we take the opportunity to thank these #FoodHeroes who, no matter the circumstances, continue to provide food for their communities and beyond - leaving no one behind.

The workshop also focused on raising awareness on Gender-Based Violence (GBV) among cocoa, vanilla and fisheries farming communities. The venue for the training was Marubian Village (Ulau 2), located along the tropical west coastline of Aitape. Lack of knowledge and skills in leadership, particularly among rural women and youth, prevents villagers from partaking equally in decision-making at the executive level of farmer groups. With this insight, the farmers were also trained on how to establish and manage their cooperatives in a gender-sensitive manner. The first sessions, focused on the importance of mainstreaming gender and youth perspectives and addressed issues of gender-based violence within the three targeted value chains. The sharing of household roles and responsibilities to allow for additional time to contribute positively in farming activities for quality and quantity production, the gender constraints in the value chain development as well as valuing everyone’s inputs by family members for appropriate reward and respect were some of the issues discussed. It was the first time that the villagers were learning about shared gender roles in contrast to some existing cultural norms. Through group discussions, participants came to realise how the sharing of household workload could improve their lives as well as their farming output. \"Everything begins in the house. As long as we share responsibilities within the house, we can save time and be more productive on the farms,\" explained Ms Patu Shang, Programme's Gender and Youth Inclusion Specialist. Learn more"

      "article_text": "Programme uses ‘talking book’ audio players to share knowledge on women’s land rights 15 September 2022, Kampala - Dramatic dialogue, music and poetry are not the usual ways that the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) raises awareness of and sensitizes rural communities on women’s land rights, but an innovative project in Uganda is doing just that through so-called Talking Books. Talking books are audio devices that allow people with low or no literacy to receive training in a dynamic way. In partnership with Amplio , a US based nonprofit social enterprise, the pilot project has adopted these easy-to-use gadgets to engage around 8,000 people, sharing stories and ideas on women's land rights and their benefits for households and communities. The Talking Books were developed by Amplio to reach remote, under-served rural populations that are often bypassed by conventional development initiatives. Designed for people with limited access to the internet or electricity, the Talking Books can play several hours of carefully tailored audio content, work offline, and function with either rechargeable or conventional batteries. Digital solutions for learning and engagement \"This initiative will shed light on how inclusive digital solutions can be powerful tools to promote social inclusion and empowerment in rural contexts, as well as innovative vehicles to drive social change and foster gender equality,\" highlighted Martha Osorio, FAO Gender and Rural Development Officer, who leads the initiative. \"The Talking Books will motivate people to reflect on the gender dimension of land issues and discuss them, inducing through debates within households and whole communities.\" The audio messages challenge discriminatory social norms and encourage new ways of thinking. For instance, one dialogue highlights the benefits that registering the land in the name of both the wife and the husband can bring to the family's well-being, because after joint registration both will be more inclined to invest in their land. Likewise, a testimony of a widow described how the community elders help her to mediate with her deceased husband’s brothers to convince them that she had the right to continue to live on, use and control the land on which she and her family have depended over the last ten years. The Talking Books content also covers other issues pertinent to agricultural contexts, such as climate change and how to mitigate its impacts on food production and farmers' livelihoods. Thanks to the support from FAO’s Flexible Voluntary Contribution (FVC), the project runs under the sub-programme “Gender Equality and Women's Empowerment in Agriculture, Food Security and Nutrition” and is now working to distribute 400 Talking Books through the Farmer Field School (FFS) networks and the Watershed Management (WM) groups in two districts in Uganda’s West Nile region, Adjumani and Moyo. The members of these groups who receive the Talking Books will have the opportunity to listen to the educational audio content at their own convenience, either on their own or together with neighbours, friends, or family members. As the devices allow users to record their questions and feedback about the project and the messages they listen to, FAO and Amplio will be able to analyze and use these data to tailor the messages for the subsequent rounds of deployment according to the users' interests, needs, and priorities. The field implementation was launched in Adjumani on 8 August 2022. The inauguration event was an opportunity to convene local government representatives and paramount chiefs, who expressed interest in and support to such a “very good”, “unique” and “innovative communication approach,” as different participants described the Talking Books. The project team conducted a baseline survey to gain a better understanding of gender dynamics and social norms within the targeted communities, as well as their knowledge and awareness of land rights and related national laws. The baseline serves to inform the programme and content design, as well as to assess changes in knowledge and attitudes among communities receiving the Talking Books by the end of the programme."

In August 2022, in the framework of the JP GTA, IFAD together with 10 technicians from the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock of Ecuador, the Institute of Popular and Solidarity Economy (IEPS) and the Municipality of Huamboya provided gender capacity strengthening for 33 leaders of rural associations. The learning activity was implemented through a methodology and training process called “Cerrando Brecha” (“Closing the Gap”) and entails that the knowledge gained is replicated in their organizations. The Cerrando Brecha methodology seeks to identify forms of gender inequity in rural organizations through practical tools that guide reflection and analysis, with the aim of reducing obstacles that limit the ability of men and women to have equal opportunities to improve their lives. Based on their shared tasks, the members agree upon transformative measures and personal development actions to strengthen the economic empowerment of rural women. For example, José Palma from the parish of General Vernaza in Guayas represents ASODULVA, an association of producers of artisanal jams made from organic fruit. José emphasized the important contribution of the Cerrando Brecha approach to the inclusive development of small farmers associations, and – together with his team – committed to replicate the methodology in their community . Likewise, 17 other organizations have benefited from a modernization of infrastructure and from learning about operational issues such as sustainability, climate change and gender equality – topics promoted by IFAD in Ecuador. In Morona Santiago, the training was carried out over the course of six days, aimed at a number of associations of rural entrepreneurs in the agricultural sector, as well as district technicians of the IEPS, the Family Farming Unit of the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Human Rights Board of local governments. Knowledge and self-assessment capacities were strengthened using a technique known as “Learn, Practice, Apply” which seeks to ensure the application of Cerrando Brecha concepts, in addition to identifying affirmative actions linked to gender equality and women's empowerment. Overall, it is aimed at developing a concrete action plan to challenge unequal conditions, in addition to triggering a theory of change and follow up on the case. Another of the beneficiary associations in the province was the Sinai (Macas) Cooperative of Agricultural Production of Sugar Cane Derivatives, made up of 70 farmers. The participants noted that the training, organized under the JP GTA, leads not only to economic development, but also to a better quality of life for the diverse members of the cooperative. The participants from the agricultural sector, who were trained as facilitators of the methodology, emphasized the fundamental contribution of the two specialists of the Cerrando Brecha methodology, Ana Lucia Moreno from Costa Rica and Elsa Tejada from El Salvador. Through the Joint Programme, they were able to highlight the power of change to reduce gender inequalities in the most vulnerable areas of the country. Workshop participants have signed a commitment letter pledging to apply the knowledge gained within their organizations and institutions. The Joint Programme on Gender Transformative Approaches for Food Security and Nutrition (JP GTA) is implemented by the United Nations Rome-based Agencies – FAO, IFAD and WFP – in collaboration with and through financial support from the European Union, with an investment of around US$ 1 million towards rural women and men in Ecuador.

      "article_text": "22 August 2022 The three-year project, “Leaving No One Behind: Greater Involvement and Empowerment of Rural Women in Türkiye and Central Asia”, aims to improve the socio-economic status of rural women by supporting inclusive agricultural and forestry policies and programmes in Türkiye, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. The first regional workshop for the project “Leaving No One Behind: Greater Involvement and Empowerment of Rural Women in Türkiye and Central Asia”, was held on 3 August in Ankara, within the framework of the FAO–Türkiye Partnership Programme on Food and Agriculture. The project will work towards eliminating gender-based discrimination and exclusion in rural areas of Türkiye, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan by providing learning and income-generation opportunities and promoting inclusion. In Türkiye, the project will support the establishment of pilots in at least three provinces, while in Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, the focus will be on building knowledge and strengthening the capacities of decision-makers to formulate and implement policies and projects based on evidence and sound gender analysis. The project will bring together beneficiaries from all three countries to share best practices and lessons learned about socially inclusive agri-food systems and women’s empowerment in rural areas. The inception workshop was the first step in this process. Representatives from the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry of Türkiye and ministries of agriculture of Tajikistan and Uzbekistan, FAO, experts, development practitioners, civil society members and other stakeholders met to discuss the project’s concept, approach and planned activities, reach a consensus and commence implementation. Evidence generated by FAO across the globe points to a strong correlation between gender inequalities, poverty and poor performance in agricultural sectors. Improving gender equality by expanding economic opportunities for women has multiple positive impacts for women, men, and their families and communities. Emphasizing the systemic barriers that women, and especially rural women, face in access to resources, education and employment opportunities, Viorel Gutu, FAO Subregional Coordinator for Central Asia and FAO Representative in Türkiye, affirmed that FAO is “committed to supporting rural women’s access to knowledge and skills”, and notied that “we also provide policy advice to institutions involved in formulating and implementing agriculture and rural development policies to help them be more responsive to the needs of the disadvantaged groups.” Nimet Kaleli, Head of the Extension and Publication Department at the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, and National Project Coordinator, explained that women in Türkiye and worldwide lead agricultural production while providing for their families and communities, and that women’s empowerment will therefore play a crucial role in poverty reduction. Kaleli also added that “Women across the globe have proven that, whenever the right opportunity, necessary means and support are given, they are capable of taking the lead in socio-economic development processes for their communities.” Nimet Kaleli emphasized that the project aims to develop an important model for eliminating gender-based discrimination and exclusion. She explained: “In three pilot districts in Türkiye, we aim to empower rural women who produce, process, join forces through local organizations such as women’s cooperatives, and market their branded production through local value chains. In this sense, our partnership with FAO represents a unique opportunity for countries worldwide who intend to create an inclusive agricultural eco-system where women drive and lead the change in sustainable development.” Participants from Tajikistan and Uzbekistan joined the workshop online. Jabbor Nosirzoda, Deputy Minister for Agriculture of the Republic of Tajikistan, underlined the importance of the project for Tajikistan where around 60 percent of workers in the food and agriculture sector are women. “However, the important role that women play remains to be recognized and women face systemic barriers, discrimination and exclusion, when compared to men”, he added. The Deputy Minister for Agriculture also expressed his confidence that overcoming rural women’s exclusion in rural areas, while providing them with equal opportunities to improve their livelihoods, will contribute to overall food security. The Ministry of Agriculture of Uzbekistan was represented by Nabira Djumaeva, Deputy Head of the Department of the National Centre for Knowledge and Innovation in Agriculture. Djumaeva expressed her appreciation for FAO’s leading role and expertise in promoting gender equality in rural communities and was confident that providing equal economic opportunities to rural women will also help the world achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The Inception Workshop also provided an opportunity for the FAO project team to meet with the representatives of provincial directorates to discuss first steps for practical implementation of the initiative. About the “Leaving No One Behind: Greater Involvement and Empowerment of Rural Women in Türkiye and Central Asia” project The project is funded by the Government of Türkiye. The overall objective is to provide policy support, capacity development and knowledge generation in order to accelerate gender equality and rural women’s economic empowerment, reduce rural poverty, and empower rural communities and organizations to access productive resources, services and markets. The project will focus on the capacity development of key stakeholders to help them better understand the concepts of gender mainstreaming. It will address rural women directly by selecting value chains in the pilot areas of Türkiye, and bring together ministries of agriculture by providing a regional space to share policy solutions, best practices and challenges related to implementing agriculture and rural development policies and programmes that are gender responsive and meet the needs of disadvantaged groups among the rural population. Furthermore, the project aims to improve rural women’s access to economic opportunities, and thus, improve their livelihoods as well as the livelihoods of their families. About the FAO-Türkiye Partnership Programmes The objectives of the FAO-Türkiye Partnership Programmes are to provide support to ensure food security, rural poverty reduction and sustainable forest management; combat desertification; and to preserve ecosystems in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Türkiye, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, and other countries of mutual interest. Established in 2007, the first phase of the FAO Türkiye Partnership Programme on Food and Agriculture (FTPP) has benefited from trust fund contributions totalling USD 10 million, financed by the Government of Türkiye and represented by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. During the first phase of the programme, 28 projects were implemented in 16 countries between 2009 and 2015. In 2014, Türkiye and FAO commenced the second phase of the FTPP along with the first phase of the FAO-Türkiye Forestry Partnership Programme (FTFP), with additional funding of USD 20 million, bringing Türkiye’s total contribution to USD 30 million."

      "article_text": "In the Republic of Moldova, far more women living in rural areas are at risk of poverty compared with men and with urban populations. The recently released National Gender Profile on Agricultural and Rural Livelihoods in the Republic of Moldova presents a snapshot of gender inequalities that affect various aspects of agricultural production and rural livelihoods in the country. Progress in advancing gender equality has been made but significant gaps remain to be closed. National data analysed in the national gender profile presents a picture of positive developments mixed with immediate challenges, such as land tenure rights, access to resources and inputs, and the negative and disproportionate impact of climate change. Women control only 19 percent of the total farmland and female farmers own less than 12 percent of all types of machinery and equipment.On the other hand, there is an upward trend in women’s engagement in entrepreneurship: more than half of the subsidized startups are run by female farmers. Building resilience against climate change In the Republic of Moldova, with financial support from the Green Climate Fund (GCF), FAO works at both the national and community levels to reduce the gender gap in agriculture through climate change adaptation measures. These measures aim to ensure that the negative impact of climate change does not compound pre-existing gender inequalities. Through its project on mainstreaming adaptation into planning process to reduce vulnerability of agriculture to climate change at local and central levels, FAO promotes gender mainstreaming into national planning processes and provides farmer training. “Climate change as a global phenomenon affects everyone, yet differently, depending on age, social and economic status, and gender, therefore, women and men experience this impact in a different way,” highlights Nina Lozinschi, gender expert of the FAO-led GCF readiness project , The project aims to identify the impact of climate change and the main vulnerabilities and impediments faced by women in agriculture and as well to encourage adaptation of the resiliency measures. The assessed needs and actions will be available for integration into policy documents at the sectoral level. During a recent project consultation for women held in Chisinau, Lozinschi said that “Men and women play different roles in agricultural production. Respectively, when designing adjustment measures to ensure preparedness for coping with climate change, we should take into account these specificities.” Participating women, coming from all over the country, shared their concerns regarding small-scale agricultural production and rural livelihood under continuous and increasing pressure of climate change. “Considering the gender dimension of agriculture, it is absolutely critical that we constantly consult with women directly involved in farming and rural life, not only to assess the vulnerabilities and to adapt the resilience measures but also to involve them in the decision making as key actors of the national process of adaptation mainstreaming,” underlined the project manager, Ala Druță. “Strengthening government capacities to formulate gender‑responsive and socially inclusive policies in the agriculture sector was and will continue to be one of FAOs’ top priorities in the country,” underlined Tudor Robu, Assistant FAO Representative in the Republic of Moldova. At the local level, six communities took part in the FAO effort to assess their vulnerabilities to climate change with the aim to create community gender sensitive climate adaptation plans. So far, over one hundred women and men have participated in the consultations and received training on how to recognizeand identify the specific vulnerabilities and potential measures for adaptation, thereby reducing the impact of climate changes on their lives and ensuring food security. The FAO project is funded by the Readiness Programme of the Green Climate Fund and is implemented in partnership with the Ministry of Agriculture and Food Industry and the Ministry of Environment. It aims to support national authorities in integrating climate change adaptation measures into agricultural sector planning while improving food security, ensuring a gender-sensitive approach, and the participation of vulnerable groups. 9 August 2022, Chisinau, Republic of Moldova"

Photo credit: ©FAO/ Max Valencia Indigenous Peoples are essential allies in global efforts to defend nature and respond to the climate crisis. With territories containing 11% of the world’s forests and covering 28% of the surface of the globe, Indigenous Peoples are guardians to almost 80% of the world’s remaining biodiversity. As the backbone of indigenous communities, indigenous women play a critical role in preserving and transmitting the ancestral knowledge that generates balance between people and nature. Indigenous women cascade their knowledge of wild, semi-domesticated and domesticated species of plants, animals and fish to enhance the resilience of future generations. “Indigenous women are champions of cultivating and preparing neglected and underutilized plant species. Their knowledge is not only key to conserving biodiversity and ensuring food security, but also to restoring ecosystems and building climate resilience,” says Nadine Valat, FAO’s GCF Coordinator. FAO is working with countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America and the Caribbean on Green Climate Fund (GCF)-financed projects that empower women as agents of change in efforts to enhance climate resilience and reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. Here are two examples of transformative FAO-led GCF projects in Chile and Nepal. Climate action with benefit-sharing in Chile About 12.8% of Chile’s 17 million people identifies as indigenous. These mostly rural communities face the most socio-economic hardships, with women – especially indigenous women – among the most vulnerable groups. According to Chile’s National Institute of Statistics ( INE ), the Mapuche are the most representative group, making up 79.8% of Chile’s Indigenous population, followed by the Aymara (7.2%), and the Diaguita (4.1%) – in addition to members of the Colla, Quechua, Rapa Nui Lickanantai, Kawashkar, and Yamana communities.

      "article_text": "When drought hits and livelihoods disappear, leaving home and separating from family members becomes a survival mechanism. ©FAO/Arete/Ismail Taxta On the outskirts of Beletweyne town in southern Somalia, Maryam Muse Duale breaks up small sticks in her hands, stoking a fire in the dirt to keep her young children warm at night. Maryam has made a flimsy shelter of sticks and cloth; it doesn’t keep the cold night air out. Her children sit on a mat, waiting for food from humanitarian agencies. When it comes, she shares among the children first. Parents eat whatever is left. Like many other rural Somalis, Maryam is facing a new reality; it is a far cry from her life as an agro-pastoralist just a few months before. The drought in Somalia, which began in late 2020, has only been spreading and deepening. Not so long ago, Maryam’s family used to raise goats, collect firewood and do some rain-fed farming to support themselves. But after three failed rainy seasons, the land has dried up, her goats are dead, and her family has been left destitute. “Before the drought, we had a cart and a donkey, and we used to harvest wood. We had no camels, but we did have goats. Now that is all gone,” she said. With no options left, her family made the tough choice to leave their home and head to the town of Beletweyne in search of help. “We came to the town here in search of life.” FAO works with families in Somalia’s drought affected areas to provide cash transfers and other livelihood assets, giving them the option to stay. ©FAO/Arete/Ismail Taxta Maryam’s family has also had to separate as a survival mechanism. The women have taken the children to town for help, while the men search for odd jobs and stay in their village to protect what’s left of their belongings. They don’t know when they will be reunited. In the Internally Displaced People (IDP) camp where Maryam and her children have found temporary shelter, everything must be provided for them – food, water, medicine. Living amongst strangers and away from the protection of their relatives, displaced women and children are also at a higher risk of gender-based violence and physical harm, not to mention disease outbreak. The decision to flee from home comes with a heavy economic and psycho-social toll. “There is a big difference between our past and our present because in our past, we were living in our homes, and if we needed anything, we had a place to go,” said Maryam. She is now entirely dependent on the goodwill of others for her survival and that of her family’s. Like Maryam, over 900 000 people have already been displaced by the drought, and this number is predicted to rise exponentially as of the end of June 2022, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA). With other agencies providing support to those in IDP camps, FAO is in the drought affected areas, providing cash transfers, livelihood assets and other support to people in their villages, giving them the option to stay and helping to decrease the massive displacement and pressure on already crowded IDP camps. With funding from United States Agency for International Development (USAID), FAO’s Cash+ project provides families with emergency cash transfers and livelihood assistance. Seeds, tools and veterinary care for animals help families to continue their work, while emergency cash assistance helps them cover other basic needs such as food, water and medicine, reducing the need to move away for services and support. Ali’s family, along with 1 874 others, have received cash transfers and livelihood assistance through FAO’s Cash+ project. ©FAO/Arete/Ismail Taxta “I’m a farmer, and I will still work here” Meanwhile, local pastoralist Ali Mohamed Wasuge has decided to stay in his village of Sariirale in central Somalia near the border of Ethiopia, though he says he has never seen the land this dry before. The earth, the trees, the bushes - all different variations of brown. “The fields are dry and without water everything we planted last season has been wiped out by the drought. Our livestock are starving,” he said. With nothing to eat, Ali’s weakened animals cannot fight off simple colds and infections and are now dying en-masse. He is watching his livelihood disappear before his eyes. Despite the challenges, Ali has chosen to stay in his home with his family. “I have seven children and live here with my wife. I’m a farmer, and I will still work here,” he said. He knows the risks involved in abandoning their farm and livelihoods, but leaving is something he thinks about every day. FAO is working to give people options. As of March 2022, Ali’s family, along with 1 874 other families in the district, had received cash transfers and livelihood assistance through FAO’s Cash+ project. Ali has so far received direct cash assistance, as well as seeds and tools for planting before the next rainy season. While only a small amount, this has enabled Ali to pay off debts and keep his family together, and the seeds will help his family bounce back faster after the drought. Keeping families together “What we are seeing are rural households facing destitution,” said FAO Representative, Etienne Peterschmitt. “They have exhausted their coping mechanisms and are moving to urban areas in search of assistance. This is what FAO is seeking to prevent,” he said. FAO’s drought response plan calls for USD 131. 4 million to reach 882 000 people in 55 districts. Cash transfers and livelihood assistance helps protect rural livelihoods and prevent a larger humanitarian crisis. Investments in livelihoods is much more efficient in the long run. For every USD 1 spent on supporting livelihoods for rural families through FAO’s programmes, USD 10 can be saved in food related assistance for a displaced family in an urban centre. And while it costs USD 40 to buy a new goat, saving a rural family’s goat from drought-related diseases costs as little as forty cents. While the drought conditions continue to get worse, FAO is working hard to scale up its assistance to rural communities and also help farmers implement practices to be more resilient to droughts, extreme weather and climate change related impacts in the future.

      "article_text": "Mamadiang Mballo and Fatoumata Kandé both work as beekeepers and are finding new ways of working together after attending a gender-sensitive, FAO farmer field school training. ©FAO/ Yacine Cissé “The turning point came when my husband and I participated in the FAO training together. That’s where my motivation to become a beekeeper came from,” says Fatoumata Kandé, a farmer and mother from the village of Sare Bidji in the Kolda region of southern Senegal. “Beekeeping in Senegal has traditionally been considered a man’s job. The training helped me understand that I too can contribute and make a difference.” As a member of the local cooperative, Coopérative Agroalimentaire de la Casamance – Miel (CAC/Miel) , Fatoumata’s husband, 52-year-old Mamadiang Mballo, has practised beekeeping for over 15 years. Beekeeping fascinated Mamadiang from a young age, but he started this livelihood with one clear objective in mind: to ensure his children got an education. Over the years, Mamadiang set off alone in the mornings to collect honey and return to sell it at the local market. But this changed after the couple attended a farmer field school together, organized as part of the FAO Strengthening Agricultural Adaptation (SAGA) project funded by the Government of Québec. The farmer field school training is part of the CasaMiel initiative, which is led by implementing partner Société de coopération pour le développement international (SOCODEVI) in partnership with the CAC/Miel cooperative and local communities. The initiative is meant to increase the production of honey in Senegal while strengthening beekeepers’ resilience in the face of climate change and reducing gender inequality in the sector. Through the gender-sensitive, farmer field schools part of the initiative, Fatoumata got inspired to engage in beekeeping and received the tools to do so. Between 2019 and 2020, FAO and its partners trained 72 women and 75 men in the production of honey through the Casa Miel initiative. ©FAO/ Yacine Cissé Bees: vital allies in a changing world Bees play a pivotal role in agriculture and are vital for the preservation of ecological balance and biodiversity in nature. Raising honeybees ensures better pollination of flowering plants. This means more food for ourselves and wildlife. However, in recent years, bees and the beekeeping sector have been hit hard by the impacts of climate change, which are seriously threatening these hardworking creatures who play a big part in the world’s crop production. Globally, three out of four crops producing fruits or seeds for human use as food depend, at least in part, on pollinators. Mamadiang describes how climate change does not spare bees or the couple’s beekeeping activities: “At one point, all the bees left the hive because it got too hot, and they had no food or water nearby.” This was one of the challenges FAO and its partners addressed through the CasaMiel initiative. “Through the training we received modern equipment including hives that do not retain heat and information on how to choose the type of hives and where to place them,” says Mamadiang. Between 2019 and 2020, FAO collaborated with six groups of the CAC/Miel cooperative which each manage a processing unit and a honey packaging plant in the area. Through the Casa Miel initiative, 49 couples received technical support and attended training workshops in the local language, Peulh . “We also got access to lighter portable hives that are easier to carry and move. All of this allowed us to adapt and even increase our beekeeping production,” he adds. With these trainings, the CAC/Miel cooperative’s sale of honey increased from 2 816 litres in 2019 to 8 840 litres in 2021. Honey from the Casamance area in the Kolda region of southern Senegal represents 70 percent of national production. In spite of this, approximately 50 percent of people in this region are affected by food insecurity and malnutrition. ©FAO/ Yacine Cissé A farmer field school with a twist The training also spread the understanding of the fundamental role that women play in agriculture and adaptation to climate change. The gender equality components of the farmer field schools promoted discussion between the couples on themes such as self-esteem, leadership and communication. They were able to draw parallels between the inequalities discussed and their personal situations and thus initiate concrete changes within the household. “The training has shown us how we can support each other as a couple. Before, I had to do everything in the household, now I share these tasks with my husband. We work as a team,” says Fatoumata. “It’s like we are operating on a different level now,” explains Mamadiang. “All decisions are made as a family.” Fatoumata has started sharing the knowledge she gained through the training with other women in the community and beyond. She is already seeing results, “It’s encouraging to see more and more women involved in beekeeping. My group at the cooperative is composed mainly of women and the president is a woman too.” Gender equality for climate adaptation Mamadiang and Fatoumata demonstrate thatby challenging the views about gender and transforming power relations, they are now better equipped to fight climate change as a team. When women have the same access as men to productive resources and services, they can significantly increase the yields on their farms and adapt to a changing climate. Tapping into the knowledge and capacity of women and having women at the table represent significant opportunities to develop new, effective climate change solutions for the benefit of all. Fatoumata feels proud of their newfound balance. “I feel valued in my relationship and that makes me happy,” she says. As a couple, they complement one another: “I bring the ability to adapt,” Mamadiang says. “I bring the quality of resilience,” Fatoumata adds.

      "article_text": "With the help of the European Union and the Global Environment Facility, FAO has set up solar-powered water systems to irrigate community vegetable gardens and provide livestock watering points, boosting food security and livelihoods for rural communities in the Gambia. ©FAO/ David Kujabi Across many parts of rural Gambia, women farmers often start their days before dawn to ensure that they have enough water to irrigate their gardens and to cook, clean and bathe at home. “Some of us would wake up as early as 3.00 a.m. to 4.00 a.m. just to get water. Hyenas attacked us on three different occasions,” said Salla Bah, a vegetable farmer in the Central River Region in the north of the Gambia. “We had to endure all these challenges to be able to water our crops and find time for chores at home.” Like most residents in her village, Salla depends on one of three deep water wells in her village. You can never be too early, and arriving at the wrong time could cost you an entire morning and the day’s wages. The vegetable farms are vital sources of income, allowing the community members to support their households with food and income. In collaboration with the Gambian Ministry of Agriculture, FAO started an initiative in 2013 funded by the European Union and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) to provide boreholes for water-deprived community gardens. However, these are no ordinary boreholes; they are equipped with solar-powered pumps that fill reservoirs kitted with filtration systems, providing clean water for irrigation and, critically, for household use and livestock. FAO is championing solar-powered innovations across the continent and beyond, ensuring that these technologies are owned and maintainted by the local communities who utilize them. ©FAO/ David Kujabi FAO has implemented 34 solar-powered water systems to irrigate community vegetable gardens and provide livestock watering points in villages all over the Gambia. This is creating a greener future for over 6 600 community members, 90 percent of whom are women. There are an additional ten solar-powered water systems for livestock that are in advanced construction in the northern part of the River Gambia, where there is severe land degradation and deforestation. “Before the installation of the solar systems and boreholes, we always had water challenges. Now that is in the past,” said Foday Jadama, a farmer in the community. “We now have water in abundance to grow anything we desire.” Supporting climate mitigation and adaptation With the effects of climate change ever-present, water access is increasingly critical to the survival of communities in the Gambia’s arid rural areas. “Aside from the economic benefits, this project is also very important when it comes to climate change,” said Dodou Trawally, the national focal person for the GEF in the Gambia. “Managing the effects of climate change is about two things,” he continued. “It is about mitigation and adaptation. This solar-powered system addresses both, hence its importance and significance to the Gambia.” With the off-grid systems irrigating the land, farmers such as Salla and Foday, are leading the charge in climate adaptation, setting an example of how green solutions can be a building block in climate action. Community members are very invested in and proud of their new water system. They received training on cleaning, monitoring and troubleshooting the solar panel system and also contribute a small monthly amount to support the system financially. ©FAO/ David Kujabi Ownership equals sustainability The local communities are taking pride in these solar-powered systems. They have a sense of ownership and are partners in the systems’ development and maintenance. Community members also contribute a small monthly amount to support the system financially, a stipulation implemented through the community’s by-laws . “I am responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of the solar panels,” Jalamang Touray said proudly. “With the help of two women, we clean the solar panels every Friday.” While other men predominantly work with millet or cowpea farming, Jalamang works on the vegetable garden with the women and youth. Together they tend to the five-hectare, GEF-funded vegetable garden. Jalamang received training on fixing basic faults in the system, cleaning the solar panels regularly and monitoring the water flow into the overhead galvanized water storage tank. By involving community members in the conception, planning, execution and maintenance of the project facilities, the people of Kuwonkuba village and 33 other communities across the country have developed self-sufficent and resilient livelihoods. They can provide for themselves and their children and experience a level of comfort they had previously never known. Now, most of the women who previously made no more than 18 USD (GMD 1 000) from each four-month farming period make about 143 USD (GMD 7 800). “The system has enabled us to financially take care of our children and health, pay school fees and look after other needs,” says Awa Mbenga of Jamali Ganyado village, standing in front of her garden with a smile. “Since we got the solar-powered water, we have time to stay at home, eat and drink tea before heading to the gardens.” With innovative solutions such as solar-powered irrigation, FAO and its partners are supporting the transformation to efficient, inclusive, resilient and sustainable agrifood systems. These innovations are helping provide viable livelihoods for the most vulnerable communities across Africa, assisiting communities to be more resilient to climate shocks and, now more than ever, capable of better production.

      "article_text": "As local fish stocks diminish, FAO implemented a programme in the Guna Yala Indigenous Peoples’ territory of Panama to work with women on how to grow, harvest and process marine algae as a new source of income. ©FAO/Epimenides Diaz On the edge of the Caribbean Sea is an autonomous, Indigenous Peoples’ territory in Panama which has been inhabited by the Guna people for centuries. It winds its way around the gulf of the same name and includes an archipelago of around 300 islands. Within this territory is Naranjo Grande, a coastal town where the sea represents food, work and life itself. This is where Luisa Lopez Hurtado has lived all her life. A member of the Guna Indigenous People, she has fished with her family off of Panama’s eastern coast for as long as she can remember. “I grew up by the sea,” says Luisa, a mother of four sons. “When I was young, I accompanied my father on his fishing trips.” For generations the Guna people have relied on marine and coastal resources for their lives and livelihoods. But Luisa, who heads the Naranjo Grande women’s association, says it’s becoming harder for fishers to make a living as local stocks of fish and lobster have been impacted by overfishing and climate change. “Fish production is different from when I was a child. There is not as much fish as there used to be, and it is increasingly difficult to find lobsters, which were plentiful in the past,” she says. Maria Dickson, a 24-year-old member of Luisa’s women’s group, confirms this. “Production has decreased drastically,” Maria says. “Sometimes I think they catch them too small and that is why they can’t reproduce.” Women play a significant role in the Guna community with many engaged in cleaning and processing fish, as well as working in agriculture, tourism and handicraft production. But they are often dependent on men for their income. The drastic fall in tourism since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic combined with declining fish stocks have had a devastating impact, pushing many families, especially women-led households, into poverty. FAO is now opening new opportunities for the Guna people by sharing skills related to algae production and processing. A new training initiative for coastal Indigenous fishers, particularly women, gives them livelihood options from a different source. Backed by the Panamanian Administration of Aquatic Resources (ARAP) and the territory’s Indigenous government, the FAO pilot programme works with 20 women and five men sharing knowledge on how to grow, harvest and process marine algae before transforming it into commercial soaps and creams. FAO helped the women create and administer a rotational fund for emergencies and supported them to organize a cooperative for selling their algae-based products. Left/top: ©FAO/Epimenides Diaz. Right/Bottom: ©FAO/Vanessa Olarte Alejandro Flores, FAO’s senior regional fisheries and aquaculture officer for Latin America and the Caribbean, says it is about increasing the resilience and independence of Guna women. “We were looking to work with an Indigenous women’s organization to contribute to their economic empowerment,” says Flores. After consultations with the Naranjo Grande association, FAO and ARAP approached Gracilarias de Panama, a private firm that specialises in the sustainable cultivation and export of marine algae. The company agreed to train the group on a probono basis and to buy their products. While Gracilarias helped build the capacity of the Guna women in cultivating marine algae, FAO worked with the women on the creation and administration of a rotational fund and helped them organize a cooperative for selling their produce. Participants planted the initial green algae in November 2021 and the first harvest took place in February 2022. They sundried the algae and learned how to extract agar, a jelly-like substance, from the walls of the algae to make soaps and cosmetics. Flores says eventually the intention of the fund, set up from the profits of these economic activities, is to finance other projects and support families during emergencies. “It’s in the early days, but they have made important progress,” says Flores. “They've already harvested twice. They feel a lot more empowered now and have contributed more to their families so they can be more autonomous.” The Indigenous women learned how to sundry the algae and extract agar, a jelly-like substance, from its walls to make soaps and cosmetics. ©FAO/Vanessa Olarte Maria says she’s already thrilled with the new skills she has learned. “I never imagined that algae could be cultivated; that was a surprise,” she says. “I can't wait for us to be able to make products and sell them locally and to tourists. That will be a great help to our economy, and I am sure there will be positive changes in the community.” Gracilarias regards the initiative as a success and a model not only for communities of women in Panama but for the entire region. Apart from those who participated, another 150 members of the Guna community hope to take part in the project in the future. Beyond the production of soaps and creams, Gracilarias says it hopes to eventually work with the Guna Indigenous women on the commercialization of dried seaweed and using seaweed planting areas as ecotourism centres to cater to local and foreign visitors. The project coincides with the International Year of Artisanal Fisheries and Aquaculture (IYAFA 2022) which highlights the critical role of small-scale fishers and fish workers and their contribution to lives and livelihoods. By recognizing the value of the work of small-scale artisanal fishers, fish farmers and fish workers, FAO is looking to create a world where they are empowered to enhance their contribution to human well-being, healthy food systems and poverty eradication through the responsible and sustainable use of marine and natural resources.

      "article_text": "Agritourism can help keep Palau’s traditional food and agricultural practices alive, reinforcing the culture while also providing an economic opportunity to showcase for visitors. ©FAO Rose Ongalibang shows off the pinkish-purple powder in a small bag. “It’s taro flour,” explains the genial retiree at her home on Palau’s largest island, Babeldaob. With its distinctive heart-shaped leaves, taro is traditionally cultivated by Palauan women in plots of land around the shores of this tiny Pacific country. The root crops provide a source of starch and have historically served as a symbol of wealth and an object of ceremonial exchange. It is also a key ingredient in Palau’s plans to make its tourism industry more sustainable, more environmentally friendly and a more level playing field for women and men. The slow food community, which Rose and a group of her female neighbours started last year, is an example of how Palau’s Sustainable Tourism Value Chain Programme is being put into action with FAO support. For the community members, it’s a chance to refocus on taro cultivation traditions, while also finding new, innovative uses for the product. Traditionally, Palauans have eaten taro plainly boiled, served with fish caught in the ocean that surrounds them. However, in a recent workshop, Rose says, “We made pasta, noodles, pasta sauce, cookies, bread and brownies,” using the taro flour and learned how best to package the products. “The potential is really big,” she says. Meanwhile, Rose and her fellow group members are also working to bring back tourism to an ancient village and its taro gardens, which had been abandoned. Tourism is the most significant driver of Palau’s economy, although arrivals were slashed by the COVID-19 pandemic. The Micronesian nation is determined to build back better with this multi-faceted project. Among the elements supported by FAO are a tourism value chain assessment focusing on the involvement of women, a database of heritage foods and processing practices, an inventory of local agroecological and cultural diversity and training workshops for producers aimed at improving nutrition. This sustainable tourism value chain programme is supported by the FAO Mountain Partnership, as well as the sub-programme, Empowering women in food systems and strengthening the local capacities and resilience of SIDS in the agrifood sector , which is funded by several resource partners under FAO’s Flexible Multi-Partner Mechanism . With Sustainable Travel International and Slow Food International as the other implementing partners, a key part of the programme is a carbon calculator, supporting Palau’s goal of turning itself into the world’s first carbon neutral tourism destination country. The calculator will help visitors work out the carbon footprint of their trip and make a financial contribution towards offsetting it locally through designated carbon sequestration sites and supporting sustainable food production. Lukes Isechal, Acting Director of the Bureau of Marine Resources, says , “We already have a network of protected areas, particularly Ngermeduu Bay, which is a large estuary lined by mangroves. I think that is the best suited potential carbon sequestration site.” Rose Ongalibang (pictured above) and some female neighbours started a slow food community exploring new uses of the traditional crop, taro. Traditional taro cultivation is also a potential draw for tourists. Left/top: ©FAO Right/Bottom: ©FAO/Riccardo De Luca Women’s contribution to value chains As Rose explains, not everyone has grown up steeped in the taro traditions. “We are learning. I am new at this. I did not really go to the taro patch when I was young, or I did but I didn’t really pay attention.” According to Jennifer Koskelin Gibbons of the Friends of Palau National Marine Sanctuary, “Making sure that those traditional practices survive does a couple of things: one, it’s sustainable by definition. Two, it contributes to reinforcing our culture and making sure that these intellectual properties of knowing how to fish and how to farm are passed down from generation to generation, but also it gives us an economic opportunity of showcasing it for visitors: this is how we’ve lived for generations and you get to be a part of it if you visit Palau.” Palauans pride themselves on being part of a matrilineal society, where women have a powerful role, though inequality in certain realms is still prevalent. “It is important to create spaces where they can talk and exchange and recognise inequalities that affect their capacity to develop their full potential,” says FAO gender specialist, Alejandra Safa. Among the issues that women have raised are the difficulty of getting bank loans, acquiring titles to land and managing a heavy day-to-day workload, she says. The project aims to reinforce women’s contribution to sustainable value chains by helping women learn new skills, get improved access to finance and better negotiate their roles within the family and community. It is crucial that the tourism initiative supports vulnerable families, including single mother households for example. “We need to help those [farmers] do what they always do, but how can we tweak it to make it something attractive for an outside person to experience,” says environmental consultant and gender researcher, Ann Kitalong. As FAO’s project focuses on SIDS and creating sustainable tourism value chains, the experience of Palau will certainly provide valuable insights to other small island states worldwide. ©FAO Reducing reliance on imports An important priority for Palau is to reduce its dependence on food imports, which accounts for up to 90 percent of the nation’s consumption. This is a reality for a great number of SIDS. Palau has set a target of producing most of its own food by 2025. For the last two years of the global pandemic, “all we talk about is food security,” says Rose, citing concern over potential disruption to food supplies arriving by ship. As FAO’s project focuses on SIDS and creating a sustainable tourism value chain, the experience of Palau is sure to provide insights worth considering for the other small island states scattered around the world’s oceans. Mountain Partnership project coordinator, Giorgio Grussu states, “The aim is to link tourism and food systems in the country and that’s something we would like to do in other countries as well.” Learn more"

      "article_text": "After attending the FAO Women’s Empowerment Farmer Business School, Agnes Rehema Chisiwa has become a successful entrepreneur, analysing the market for what crops to grow and actively sharing the knowledge she has gained. ©FAO/Patrick Meinhardt She smiles widely and her face beams with pride. Seeing Agnes Rehema Chisiwa in her garden of carefully selected and curated tomato plants, there is no doubt that she is proud of what she has accomplished. Agnes is now the chairperson of the Juhudi Farmer Field School in Kilifi South, Kenya. She has become a visionary entrepreneur and a dedicated trainer who enjoys sharing her knowledge with other local farmers. Through her training, she focuses on agricultural business development and prepares both women and men to challenge local traditions and customs that hinder women from having an equal say. “We, women farmers, face so many challenges because of the several roles we play,” says Agnes. “Women bear all the burden of family responsibilities, from the time they wake up until they go to bed. Women are expected to wash dishes, clean the house, fetch water from the well, carry pregnancies, attend school meetings and cook for their husbands and children. At the same time, they also need to attend community meetings and work on the farms.” Until a few years ago, Agnes had difficulty to discuss financial matters openly with her husband, and they never consulted each other when making decisions, which is true for many families in rural Kenya. “Whenever my husband got some money, we would never talk about it,” regrets Agnes. “He got his money and I got mine. I would buy a packet of flour and while coming home from work he would also buy a packet of flour. Then, we would end up having two packets of flour but no other food items for the meal, like vegetables.” Things started to change in 2020, when Agnes attended an FAO-organized training through the Women’s Empowerment Farmer Business School (WE-FBS), an innovative initiative that promotes gender equality and economic empowerment of rural women in the areas of agriculture and food production. It reinforces the capacities of female and male farmers to create profitable agricultural enterprises and, at the same time, transforms gender relations in households, communities and markets by encouraging participants to critically reflect on and discuss gender challenges, dig into their causes and come up with possible solutions. Husbands, wives and mature children also develop a five-year visioning plan together on their family and business affairs. Agnes was among the 100 facilitators from the Kilifi county who participated in the WE-FBS training provided by FAO in partnership with the Government of Kenya through the Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment in Agriculture, Food Security and Nutrition , an initiative funded by FAO’s Flexible Multi-Partner Mechanism (FMM). “Following the WE-FBS training, I can now sit with my husband and plan together. We agreed that one of us should buy flour while the other buys vegetables. Same thing for our children’s school uniforms. I buy the shirts, and he buys the shorts. So, right now, all is well between us thanks to the training,” celebrates Agnes. Women and men were eager to participate in the WE-FBS training in Kenya, where they learned more about challenging gender norms and strengthening their farming business skills. ©FAO/Patrick Meinhardt Learning about markets While encouraging family dialogue, the FAO training has also helped Agnes and other group members to develop their farming skills and better understand how to leverage markets. Using the knowledge from the training, Agnes conducted a market survey which showed a great demand for tomatoes and other vegetables in the local market due to the prevailing drought in her county. As a result, she started growing them, and now she expects to earn more income from selling these crops at the market. “Before we produce crops, we must conduct a market survey. We should not plant crops that do not have a ready market. The training was a watershed for us,” details Agnes. “We must take into consideration what products are available in the market from the buyers’ perspective. We need to ask them what they would be interested in buying and at what prices,” she adds. In partnership with World Vision International, the WE-FBS initiative has prepared 15 master trainers and has built the capacities of 257 farmer facilitators who have, in turn, transferred the WE-FBS skills to further 2 678 farmers. The expectation is to reach 5 200 women and 1 300 men farmers by the end of the pilot phase in 2022. “By involving both men and women, the WE-FBS approach gives space for unpacking gender norms while strengthening entrepreneurial skills and capacity to improve their farm business activities, engage in lucrative value chains and pursue market opportunities,” stresses Carla Mucavi, FAO Representative in Kenya. “The approach also includes different tools to tackle negative norms that hinder women and men from improving their wellbeing and attaining their full potential.” The WE-FBS has passed on skills to almost 3 000 farmers. The programme is also being rolled out in Cambodia, Senegal and Uganda. ©FAO/Patrick Meinhardt “Agnes is much more than a tomato and vegetables grower. She is a powerful woman who has overcome deep-rooted, socio-cultural norms,” says Queen Katembu, FAO WE-FBS Coordinator in Kenya, who trained Agnes and saw her speaking up more at home and in the community. “Thanks to the training, she has become more skilled in planning expenses, joined a Village Savings and Loan Association, opened a bank account and developed a good basis to obtain loans.” While her business grows, Agnes knows exactly what she wants. “I have a target and a five-year vision of what I plan to achieve. For instance, right now I need a [water] pump and I have started saving to buy one. Now, I save with a target. I know I will get that pump thanks to my savings.” Farmers who have taken the WE-FBS training are applying what they learned to other farming initiatives in the country. These trainings are also being rolled out in Cambodia, Senegal and Uganda, aiming to enhance women’s equitable participation in farming and close the gender gap in agriculture. Learn more"

      "article_text": "Olga Babayeva is an Azerbaijani businesswoman and a strong supporter of women in farming. FAO has supported her with training to become a mentor for other women in agriculture. ©FAO/Emil Yusubov Olga Babayeva, a 52-year-old farmer from Samukh region in northwestern Azerbaijan, is a well-recognized businesswoman in her community. Apart from being the biggest producer of vegetable seeds for onions, coriander, dill, radishes and parsley, among others, she is also known for her strong support of women’s engagement in farming. She was attracted to farm life as a young child, spending her summer holidays helping her parents plant vegetables. In the 1990s, after the collapse of the Soviet Union , a nineteen-year-old Olga became the first young female farmer in Fuzuli village when she started renting a 10-hectare plot to grow beetroot. “But it was not that easy,” says Olga with a smile, who now cultivates a total of 14 hectares. For more than 30 years she has been active in agriculture beyond just growing crops. She also manages the vegetable seed cooperative Barakat (meaning “blessing” in Azeri) with 1 400 members and established the Samukh Seed and Vegetable Corporation that ensures laboratory testing for seed sorting and drying. Today, the corporation sells seeds in both national and foreign markets. “In the beginning, I faced situations where tractor drivers (who were usually men) would refuse to cultivate my land just because I was a woman, or officials in the local government body neglected my requests as they did not accept the fact that a woman can be engaged in farming professionally,” reminisces Olga. “‘Your place is in the kitchen, not on the land’ this is what women hear very often.” Empowering rural women through agriculture has great potential in the country. According to the State Statistics Committee of Azerbaijan, 77 percent of women reside in rural areas, and the percentage of female entrepreneurs engaged in agriculture, forestry and fishing is higher than men (32 versus 24 percent). However, women face a number of challenges, such as a gender pay gap, informality of jobs and a triple work burden (housework, production for the household and wage work). In total, women do an average of six hours of unpaid work, while men spend only two hours on the same. Additionally, poor access to social services hinders many women from leveraging their full potential. FAO and the Government of Azerbaijan have been providing training to rural women to improve their farming practices through innovative technologies and heighten their agricultural knowledge. Left/Top: ©FAO/Emil Yusubov Right/Bottom: ©FAO/Abdul Mustafazade “As I was divorced with a little son and daughter on my hands, I had no other option than to earn a living to survive. I had to work much harder than any other fellow male farmer as I bore triple responsibilities: working on the farm and at home, as well as engaging in village initiatives,” notes Olga. “Today, my children are adults, but the perceptions and challenges are still there.” As a result of her experiences, she knows very well the difficulties women face in agriculture as she had to go through many of them. This is why FAO believed her the perfect person to mentor other women farmers. To this end, Olga received several FAO trainings on farming and business management and participated in a training for trainers’ workshop. Since 2020, FAO, in cooperation with the Government of Azerbaijan, has been providing support to rural women to improve their knowledge and farming practices through innovative technologies in cultivating fruit trees and vegetables, cattle breeding and poultry raising, among other areas. “Women are engaged in agricultural production; however, they tend to have less training in sales and marketing and have little information about micro-credits and non-financial services,” points out Flora Poladova, leading FAO project expert in Azerbaijan. “With the improved farming techniques, they will be able to do commercial farming. Increasing their income through essential business, marketing and leadership skills will, in fact, raise women's self-confidence and make their voices heard.” FAO connects women farmers to each other and to providers that offer financial and advisory services, helping support their agricultural production and businesses. ©FAO/Emil Yusubov “FAO plays an intermediary role between female farmers and state and private service providers. We are working now to bridge this, so that will help women to learn about free advisory services, soft loans and other services,” adds Poladova. To keep up the momentum, the FAO project mobilizes rural women’s groups and has already succeeded in connecting over 100 female farmers from 20 regions in Azerbaijan. As part of this network, Olga communicates with other members and shares farming knowledge via a mobile messaging app. “I am so happy to be part of the big changes ahead!” beams Olga. “I am grateful women are not alone, and support is there. Women and girls deserve fair opportunities and treatment and, once financially stable, they will have a stronger voice to be equally recognized.” Through this project, FAO is working with the Government of Azerbaijan to better respond to current and future challenges in the agriculture sector, engaging women as key to making the sector more productive and inclusive.

      "article_text": "By providing guidance on planting vegetable gardens and helping people monitor what they are eating, the My Kana smartphone app is addressing diet-related health issues in Fiji. © FAO Irene Chief’s words are stark as she describes what spurred her and her colleague Kama Ateca to do something about unhealthy diets in their island nation of Fiji. Seeing co-workers in their thirties or forties dying of heart attacks “will leave you traumatised,” she says. “We go to more and more funerals of young people… when people leave families at 30 or 40, we really need to look at our diet.” This deep-seated concern at the impact of diet-related Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) led Irene, who works at the University of the South Pacific, and Ateca, who is a senior official at Fiji’s Health Ministry, to begin collaborating on the My Kana smartphone app. It helps Fijians both monitor what they’re eating and gives them guidance on planting vegetable gardens. My Kana (meaning “food” in Fiji’s indigenous iTaukei language) was one of the innovations showcased at the Small Island Development States (SIDS) Solutions Forum , co-organized by FAO and the government of Fiji in August 2021. The challenges the app is designed to address are far from unique to Fiji. In fact, many countries around the world, and many SIDS in particular, face a “triple burden of malnutrition” — underweight, overweight and obesity accompanied by micronutrient deficiencies. Modern lifestyles are changing Fijians’ traditional dietary patterns from local root crops to a more cereal-dense diet and from eating local vegetables and fruits to consuming too much fatty, sugary or salty, often imported, processed foods. The transformation is particularly pronounced among Fijians living in urban areas, whose diet and lifestyles have changed radically from those of their parents’ or grandparents’ generation. “Our population is also consuming a lot more kilocalories, and with insufficient physical activity, that is contributing to NCDs,” Ateca says. According to Fiji’s Health Ministry, NCDs are responsible for around 80 percent of the deaths in the country and the numbers are growing. So just how significant is this innovation, which sits on thousands of Fijians’ smartphones? Irene says, “You have to remember that Fiji has 300 islands so how do you have people access information?” Different from the laid-back, idyllic image of the South Pacific presented in novels or tourist brochures, island living presents many challenges, according to Irene. Boat journeys between islands are time-consuming and air trips expensive, “but we’re a very fast-changing society,” offers Irene. With increasing deregulation of the internet, “we’re able to use mobile phones and that’s why we developed the app. With innovation, our people have always tried to find ways of adapting and adjusting especially when there’s not much money available. That’s why we also offer this app for free, which is unusual,” Irene adds. Modern lifestyles are changing Fijians’ traditional diet. The app hopes to reverse some of the unhealthy eating habits developed. ©My Kana Focusing on Pacific foods Also innovative is the fact that the app is based on locally available foods taken from the current Pacific Island Food Composition Tables, which was co-produced by FAO and the University of the South Pacific. Although it dates from 2004, it is still regarded as an authoritative guide on nutrition by experts across the region and is widely used for calculating nutrient intake, planning nutrition improvement programmes and shaping special diets for people with various diseases. But it’s not available in such a handy form. Irene says, “The app also has all the foods of Fiji and all the processed foods. So it [the app] gives all the different nutrient components. Once you put the amount of food, for example a piece of chicken … it will do a calculation on how many calories, how much protein, how many vitamins.” Meanwhile, the gardening feature encourages users to grow their own food. “This component explains how you can start your own garden and also informs on homemade pesticides and fertilizers,” says Alvina Deo of Fiji’s National Food and Nutrition Centre, as she presented the app at the SIDS Innovation Forum. “It’s a whole package on healthy eating from growing to what you are eating at home. So there are no more excuses for people to say they cannot have gardens or cannot plant at home because the app addresses all these issues,” adds Alvina. “That’s innovation in itself as we are aligning our available resources to be able to try to measure and offer nutrition to our people,” Irene says. Ateca adds, “Part of the innovation idea too is to gradually increase or improve what our original product is meant to be.” FAO’s SIDS Solution Platform, in addition to the SIDS solution Forum and Dialogue, have propelled the implementation of innovative ideas like My Kana. Innovations are essential for transforming food production, distribution and consumption. ©My Kana The project was conceived and put into action before the COVID-19 pandemic drastically curtailed the Health Ministry’s in-person outreach sessions to convey messages about diet and health, only heightening the importance of a digital approach. The switch to digital is a pattern that has been observed across the Asia-Pacific region, even though the nature of the innovation varies. The hope is eventually to expand the app’s coverage to at least a dozen Pacific island nations, using their own distinct languages and basing it on their local foods. FAO has already provided support for producing a custom-made version of the app for neighbouring Tonga. However, bringing the full vision to fruition will require finding additional sources of funding. In addition, says Kama, “in the island nations, face to face meetings enable trust and good working relationships.” So as well as finance, the way the COVID-19 pandemic evolves is also likely to play a crucial role. Building on the momentum of last year's Forum, an FAO SIDS Solutions Dialogue in February 2022 generated momentum for launching more innovative ideas like My Kana and scaling them up. Innovations like these are essential for transforming food production, distribution and consumption - realizing FAO’s goals of better production, better nutrition, better environment and better livelihoods.

Drying racks provided by the project helped improve the processing and the quality of silverfish, making them available for human consumption and sell at higher prices. ©FAO/Agatha Ayebazibwe On the Ugandan shores of the largest lake in Africa, fishers were increasingly coming up empty-handed. Lake Victoria once boasted 500 species of fish but in recent years overfishing and poor fishing practices have taken a heavy toll on fish stocks, the environment and the communities who depend on them. “I was a fisherman using illegal methods,” says Kigozi Robert Sande, a fisher in the Kalangala district. “When the Ugandan government ran an operation to stop these practices, we became jobless.” Many fishers like Robert were fishing without permits or using small boats and nets that were not allowed on the lake. For example, some were using a specific type of net, seine nets, to trap immature fish, though illegal. When the government cracked down, “a big percentage of people were left without a source of livelihood, and they were dependent on fishing,” says Jacob Olwo, FAO Fisheries and Aquaculture Officer working in Uganda. One million people in Uganda are engaged in capture fisheries, while more than five million people across the country depend on the sector for their livelihoods. However, fishing communities around the lake have been dealing with declining catches, poor handling facilities, increased post-harvest losses, greater competition for fishing resources and limited sources of income for some time.

      "article_text": "Inspired by her favourite radio show, Ramkali is working to challenge gender norms in her community. ©Equal Access International A voice comes through the radio. It is Ramkali Mahato’s favourite show. She turns up the volume to hear local women talking with elected officials about empowerment issues and traditional social norms. Inspired by the show, Ramkali now strives to do the same in her daily life, speaking up against discrimination in her community and ensuring a better future for her own children. 36-year-old Ramkali had only completed the seventh grade when, at 12 years old, she was married. In her area of southeastern Nepal, child marriage is still practiced despite being illegal. At just 14 years old, she gave birth to her son, swiftly followed by another son and a daughter. As part of the Madheshi community, a socially and economically marginalised community in Nepal, many women from her area face structural barriers including discriminatory policies, legislation and social norms, like child marriage, which hinder their access to education, jobs and opportunities. They carry the disproportionate share of unpaid domestic work and are often excluded from participation and leadership in public life. Challenging social norms During the COVID-19 pandemic, Ramkali began listening to “Sambal”, a radio show broadcasted by the Joint Programme on Rural Women’s Economic Empowerment (JP RWEE). The programme was implemented by FAO, the International Fund for Agricultural Development, UN Women and the World Food Programme and supported by the governments of Norway and Sweden. It aims to tackle the deep-rooted causes of gender inequality and boost rural women’s economic empowerment, which includes facilitating access to opportunities, resources and services, including land, credit and technologies. JP RWEE works with national and local governments, communities and households to tackle unequal power dynamics and discriminatory social norms in order to achieve lasting change. On the live radio programme, locally elected leaders address the women’s queries and concerns on topics like gender equality, financial knowledge and harmful social norms that underpin violence against women and girls. The show also highlights individual and community actions that can be taken to combat the issue. “I loved the radio programme so much that I used to go around to my neighbours’ houses every week and turn on the radio myself if they had forgotten to listen to it,” Ramkali says, laughing. By listening to Sambal, Ramkali realized how difficult it was for women in her traditional rural community to create a life outside the home, and she set out to challenge these norms. In her area, farming groups and local councils are predominantly led by men with women given little space to participate in decision-making. But with help from the JP RWEE, Ramkali took leadership of the Laxmi Rural Women Farmers Group and encouraged other women in her area to do more outside their homes. “Our voices are often suppressed by the men in my village. But Sambal has given us the strength, courage and a platform to have our voices heard,” she says. With skills taught through the JP RWEE, Ramkali and her husband have boosted their income from farming. ©FAO Put to the test Her newfound leadership was immediately put to the test by the COVID-19 lockdown, during which, Ramkali says, there were many cases of domestic violence in her community. She used her position of leadership to speak out against these practices, something that in Nepal’s traditional society is already a big step forward. “Our access to local authorities was limited due to the restrictions caused by the lockdown. Taking inspiration from the radio show, I along with other women from my group raised our voices against violence. I even got a chance to speak about these issues directly with the leaders in my community and to encourage them to take serious steps to tackle the issues.” A leader in the community The JP RWEE has helped Ramkali not just to find her voice but earn an income too. Before joining the programme, Ramkali’s family practiced traditional farming and managed to grow just enough to feed themselves. However, after training and inputs from the JP RWEE, she has become skilled enough at vegetable farming to rent a larger piece of land and start commercial farming. In the five years since the programme began, her annual income has risen by over 2 000 percent. This allowed Ramkali the financial freedom to maintain her house and even pushed her to make sure her daughter had the same access to education as her sons during COVID-19. In the lockdown, sons were given preference to attend online classes whereas daughters were supporting their mothers in the household chores. This seemed wrong to Ramkali, and after she spoke out, girls were encouraged to attend online classes too. “I struggled a lot in my life as I was married when I was a child and did not have an opportunity to continue my education,” Ramkali says. “I do not want my daughter, or others in our community, to face the same challenge.” The JP RWEE programme has empowered Ramkali to make her own choices and take a leadership role in her community. ©FAO For Ramkali, the JP RWEE programme empowered her to make her own choices. “It changed my life by giving me an opportunity. It has changed my relationship both at home and in my community, as my voice is heard these days. I am now confident that I can live my life without being dependent on my husband or any other family members.” Though challenged by her community and even her husband at the beginning, gradually, they saw how hard she worked and the difference she was making. Her husband began appreciating her ability to help support their family, and her community saw how Ramkali was creating a fairer society for women and building the confidence of other women to join her. Sometimes, it takes just one strong woman to make big changes to society. Learn more"

For Loyda and her staff, steady and reliable milk production means the world, allowing them to pay for their household needs, children’s school fees, house maintenance expenses and starting a family. However, Loyda was deeply concerned: her animals were in poor health and produced little. “They don’t look okay. You can tell from their coats; they are not shiny.” Hunger, malnutrition and disease haunted the farm. The biggest challenge was the lack of feed. The cows walk around the farm and eat the grass that grows naturally during the wet season, March to November, Loyda explained. However, when the dry season starts, the farm runs out of feed quickly. “We have cows that actually died of hunger,” Loyda adds sadly. What’s worse, climate change has prolonged the dry season and drought hits the farm more often than ever before. Combined with pests and diseases, the ill-being of the cows casts a shadow on the income of the farm, threatening the livelihoods of Loyda and her workers. “SSC helps a lot” Despite all of these challenges, Loyda had large ambitions. Her goal was to be able to produce over 1 000 litres of milk per day, even though the farm was barely making 500 litres. She had no idea where to begin. Then she heard about an FAO project that was teaching farmers to enhance the production and productivity of their farms. Learn more"

      "article_text": "New joint programme by FAO and ITC seeks to empower women and enhance their livelihoods in the African Continental Free Trade Area 5 April 2022, Accra – The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) has combined efforts with the International Trade Centre (ITC) SheTrades Initiative to support women in overcoming gender-based obstacles in the context of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA). A new joint programme launched today will promote women’s readiness to engage in negotiations around the AfCFTA, as well as their access to capacity building and higher-productivity activities, capitalizing on the new opportunities in regional trade created by the agreement. Spanning over 12 months, the collaboration aims to empower women producers, processors, and traders in agriculture and agro-processing value chains via initiatives which will bring together a wide variety of stakeholders. Through continental private-public sector dialogues, FAO and ITC will present recommendations for mainstreaming gender in trade policies to government representatives. The dialogues will also enable women’s groups to articulate their needs, challenges and priorities so that policymakers can determine appropriate measures to improve the business environment for women. FAO and ITC will also host capacity building sessions for women’s associations and cooperatives on trade procedures for small enterprises, compliance with sanitary and phytosanitary regulations, access to finance and investment, e-commerce and digitalization, and practical market research. The sessions will include a training of trainers to ensure long-term sustainability of the learning processes. “Some of the benefits that women can reap by trading under the AfCFTA include moving up the value chain, leveraging networks of women’s associations, upgrading their businesses, and tapping into new markets and investment opportunities. However, by creating new formal regulated markets, the AfCFTA will trigger a structural shift in the way certain economic activities and businesses are conducted in Africa. Currently, 85 percent of economic activity in Africa is carried out in the informal sector where women account for nearly 90 percent of the labour force, and their specific needs and challenges are not yet adequately considered in trade policy frameworks,” said Abebe Haile-Gabriel, FAO Assistant Director General and Regional Representative for Africa. Inclusive value chains for inclusive economic development In addition to the dialogues and training sessions, value chains with a high potential for women to flourish will be analysed in depth to identify women’s current roles, barriers and opportunities, and potential synergies. The studies will be used to mobilize human and financial resources towards the enhanced engagement of women in the selected value chains. The studies will also provide a basis for capacity building activities for women producers interested in trading within these markets. So far, cassava, fish, maize, poultry, livestock and rice have been identified as promising value chains. “Our objective is to support countries in negotiating and implementing an inclusive AfCFTA: an AfCFTA that opens opportunities for women to participate in African trade, move up regional value chains and reap more benefits for themselves and their communities. ITC has already done significant work with women producers and their associations to empower them to benefit from the AfCFTA and I look forward to this partnership with FAO to reach more women in the agricultural sector,” said Pamela Coke-Hamilton, Executive Director of ITC. The farmer leader Yagu Bangura poses in front of seed bags stored at the warehouse of the Tauropanneh Agri-business Centre in Bombali District, Sierra Leone © Sebastian Liste The AfCFTA spans over 54 countries and supports a market of over 1.4 billion people with a combined gross domestic product of USD 2.5 trillion and growing. While the new free trade area presents a ground-breaking opportunity to boost Africa’s share of global trade and achieve the goals of Agenda 2063, such objectives can only be accomplished if the implementation of the agreement is fair and inclusive. Currently, women in business in Africa face challenges related to working in the informal sector, complying with legal requirements, and accessing market information, training and finance, among other issues. The FAO-ITC gender and trade programme is a solid representation of FAO’s ongoing efforts to mainstream gender equality in regional agricultural sector policies and programmes while promoting concrete opportunities for boosting women’s livelihoods and capacities in value chains and agribusiness in the continent. The programme also builds on ITC’s SheTrades Initiative and One Trade Africa programme. The SheTrades Initiative works to foster more inclusive business and policy ecosystems and increase the competitiveness of women entrepreneurs and women producers and connect them to markets, and the One Trade Africa programme works to empower, enhance and enable MSMEs to access business opportunities in Africa. Through this collaboration, FAO and ITC hope to to accelerate the many benefits and economic growth associated with the roll-out of the AfCFTA.

The objective of the virtual tour was to showcase the impact of the Zimbabwe Resilience Building Fund (ZRBF) programme interventions as well as give ZRBF key stakeholders, and other participants an opportunity to listen to the contributions that the programme has made in alleviating the effects of climate change across the 18 ZRBF districts. The ZRBF project has been building different resilience capacities of women to deal with hazards and disasters among beneficiaries As we celebrate this year’s international women’s month under the theme, ‘ Changing Climates: Equality today for a sustainable tomorrow, ’ FAO believes that the contribution of women and girls to building sustainable agri-food systems is anchored around building their resilience. In Zimbabwe, FAO has been building resilience of women through various programmes that promote women through asset ownership; access to training and information on climate change; challenging gender social norms that discriminate women among other gender sensitive programmes and interventions aimed at addressing and achieving SDGs 1 and 2 to end hunger and poverty. “The virtual showcases demonstrated that through the ZRBF, women are key to learn and implement innovative approaches to disaster risk management. When women are educated and are able to mobilize financial resources, they are more keen to invest in their families. That is the reason why women should be empowered by owning assets, and decide on the use of their resources. When women are empowered, they can organize themselves in the communities and better take care of their families,” said Dr. Patrice Talla, FAO Subregional Coordinator for Southern Africa and FAO Representative to Zimbabwe. Droughts are now a common phenomenon in southern Africa and of late have been more frequent. They used to be a 10-year cycle but now recurring every three years. The countries in the region are therefore experiencing droughts and their effects. “We need to look at innovative ways of building resilience such as promotion of the small grains, and climate smart agriculture. Building the resilience of rural women entails building resilience of households and communities to not only survive and recover from current crises such as droughts, but also strengthen their defences in the face of future threats,” added Dr. Talla. The ZRBF project, funded by the European Union (EU), Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO), Sweden, and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), in partnership with the Ministry of Lands, Agriculture, Fisheries, Water, and Rural Development showcased a number of projects that are empowering women to mitigate the effects of climate change. It is a long-term development initiative with an overall objective of contributing to increased capacity of communities to protect development gains in the face of recurrent shocks and stresses enabling them to contribute to the economic development of Zimbabwe. Governments officials, NGOs, UN agencies and other development partners commended the interventions showcased during the virtual tour. Development partners acknowledged that women now understand disaster risks, which is why they are now investing in small grains and harvesting water. There was also recommendation to adopt rights-based approach for sustainability of the gains achieved through building the resilience of women as often women are not the registered owners of livestock, infrastructure or household assets, therefore they need to enjoy the fruits of their labour. The overall objective is to ensure that the households are now food and nutrition secure. FAO joins Zimbabwe in celebrating the international women’s month of March and beyond. As we continue supporting building the resilience of women in Zimbabwe, FAO has lined up a number of projects that will complement Government efforts, development partners and the ZRBF. These projects are aimed at making the FAO Zimbabwe fit-for-purpose in achieving the Four Betters (better production, better nutrition, better environment and a better life) which are enshrined in the FAO Strategic Framework (2022-2031).

This year's theme is “Gender equality today for a sustainable tomorrow,” targeting the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls in the context of climate change, environmental and disaster risk reduction policies, and programmes. On this occasion, FAO staff working on the ground have been asked to share their thoughts on the advances in gender equality. Why is women’s economic empowerment so important? As the main producers, farmers, and entrepreneurs in labour-intensive agriculture and the rural economy in Albania, women demonstrate impressive resilience and contribute significantly to their food security and nutrition, caregiving, and wellbeing. Therefore, for Albania, the economic empowerment of rural women has multiplier effects and serves as an important channel of substantial progress and positive change to reduce the gender gap. This is also a prerequisite for [agrifood systems] transformation and gender equality, encouraging more innovative rural communities. –Merita Mece, gender specialist and coordinator of gender rural equality and tourism project, Albania Learn more"

This, along with a vibrant fishing industry make up the mainstay of the Dominican economy and participation in agriculture can be found throughout the island. “In Dominica, this is what we are known for, so we try to limit use of pesticides and educate as much as we can on the dangers of their use to maintain this reputation. The diversity of people means that there is varying use in our farming communities.

      "article_text": "On the occasion of International Women’s Day ( IWD ) on 8 March, the Government of Cambodia and the FAO Representation in Cambodia have called for robust efforts against gender-based discrimination and bias through investments in local capacity development and ownership, highlighting the progress made in this direction through their joint activities under FAO’s Flexible Multi Partner Mechanism ( FMM ). “If we want to foster women ’s economic empowerment in a sustainable way, we must advance a long-term vision that addresses the root causes of gender inequalities,” said H.E. Hor Malin, Secretary of State of Cambodia’s Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (MAFF) and Head of the Gender and Children Committee. “This is precisely what we are focusing on. Through our joint work with FAO, we aim to promote a legacy of capacities and knowledge that will enable women and men to critically reflect on their social attitudes, shift their mindsets, and hence have the opportunity to thrive in equal terms.” Ms Rebekah Bell, FAO Representative in Cambodia, stressed how crucial gender equality is for long-lasting food and nutrition security: “ Achieving Zero Hunger requires closing the existing gender gaps through transformative approaches that induce new ways of thinking among individuals, households, communities, institutions, policies and legislation.” Under the FMM Subprogramme Gender Equality and Women’s Empowerment in Food and Agriculture , the Government and FAO are piloting two gender-transformative approaches in the context of food and agriculture for the first time in the region, namely, the Dimitra Clubs (DCs) and the Women’s Empowerment Farmer Business Schools (WE-FBS). The DCs represent a community-led, participatory approach that places a strong emphasis on gender and social inclusion and also tackles intersecting inequalities and patterns of marginalization. The members (men, women and youth) of the DCs hold discussions to find and implement solutions to locally based problems using their own knowledge, skills and resources. FAO is promoting the DCs approach to achieving gender equality in 20 villages of the Banteay Meanchey and Siem Reap Provinces, in collaboration with the Village Support Group , the local partner that will be facilitating field activities. The 1 307 members (60% women) of the 40 newly created DCs in Cambodia have already identified 41 development issues that they consider important, which include village road issues, poor waste management, the lack of necessary infrastructure and technical know-how to support agricultural activities, the lack of clean water for drinking and children dropping out of school. Additionally, some DCs have also placed emphasis on the need to end domestic violence. With the aim of facilitating women’s participation in agribusinesses , the MAFF is collaborating with the Ministry of Women Affairs (MoWA) to implement the WE-FBS. This approach applies a gender perspective to business skills-development interventions and the promotion of family farming as a business. Through a series of learning and facilitation sessions, it works with mixed producers’ groups and creates a safe space for unpacking gender norms while strengthening farmers’ entrepreneurial skills and capacity to improve farm business activities through engagement in lucrative value chains and the pursuit of market opportunities. The launch, implementation and evaluation of the approach allows for men and women to reflect critically on their roles, resources and activities in farming, and to develop strategies that are needed to maximize their commercial potential. Therefore, WE-FBS looks at how men and women can sustainably increase farm profits by valuing their respective contributions to family farming . As of today, a total of 60 WE-FBS groups have been established, reaching more than 1 200 women and men. “This approach is different because it looks at gender in depth. It is not only about ensuring women ’s participation, but it also gives space to discuss inequalities and empowers farmers to apply the tools on their own,” said one WE-FBS facilitator, Ms. Champey Ream from Phnom Srok district of Banteay Meanchey province. “This tool helps us to establish the long-term vision for our families. If you have the dream, you can try to walk through it and achieve what you want in the future,” commented a farmer participating in the WE-FBS learning cycles, Mr. Hos Salon from Svay Chek district of Banteay Meanchey province. The objective of the FMM Subprogramme is to contribute to closing the gender gap in agriculture by enhancing rural women’s economic empowerment and strengthening their crucial role in rural development, decision-making and resilience building, as agents of change. Men are also key partners in unpacking challenging gender stereotypes and biases and promoting an inclusive culture that will benefit the whole community. Share this page"

      "article_text": "An FAO-led Green Climate Fund project in Nepal gives women a voice as advocates for climate action Women observe Nepal's churia landscape which is particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change ©FAO/ Sangita Budhathoki Climate change disproportionally affects women and girls. It magnifies inequalities. Poor women whose livelihoods depend on agriculture and natural resources are particularly vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, such as extreme weather events, droughts, floods and temperature rise. The impacts of climate change have a ripple effect on their lives, jeopardising food security, income and well-being. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) and the Green Climate Fund (GCF) are scaling up investments in the agriculture, forestry and fisheries sector to empower women as equal advocates for climate solutions. Gender action is interwoven into FAO’s entire GCF project portfolio – valued at USD 937.7 million – to ensure that women and girls have a leading role to play as change-makers in the transition towards a low-carbon, climate-resilient future. Here is an example of how an FAO-led GCF project in Nepal – with USD 47.3 million in climate investments – is giving women a voice in climate change adaptation and mitigation action on the ground. Empowering women for climate resilience in Nepal Around 3.2 million women and men in Nepal’s Churia region depend on local natural resources for food, water and energy, but the area is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change, such as extreme rainfall and flash flooding. The river and forest ecosystems are also under pressure because of unsustainable land use, deforestation and forest degradation. FAO is working with Nepal’s Ministry of Forests and Environment on a flagship GCF project that breaks down inequalities by increasing women’s participation in climate-resilient and sustainable natural resource management. Local communities have been taking part in an FAO-designed critical ecosystem restoration plan, involving twenty-six vulnerable river systems in the region. So far, over four hundred women and men have participated in consultations that will help promote the adoption of climate-resilient land use, thereby reducing deforestation and forest degradation. “I feel proud to walk together with the ward chairperson, government officers, and other highly knowledgeable people,” says Narayani Pokharel, a member of the ‘Women Saving and Credit’ group of the Chaarnath River system, Dhanusha District. “I’ve never been involved in an activity like this and I hope it addresses our problems.” Narayani Pokharel, with her five-year-old daughter, is a member of the ‘Women saving and credit’ group, who participate in consultations on ecosystem restoration plans in the Chaarnaath River system, Nepal. Photo credit: ©FAO/Sangita Budhathoki Amplifying women’s voice Over six hundred women and women-led organizations will ultimately lend their voice to sustainable natural resource management plans that will have a positive impact on their lives. The critical ecosystem restoration plan – known as CERP – breaks down barriers for women and girls; it recognises their leading role as promoters of sustainable land-use practices that help communities adapt to a changing climate and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. “As women, our voice is usually not heard and we are not considered valued decision-makers, but now we are a part of the planning process, so I hope our voice will be incorporated into the final plan,” says Urmila Paswan, who lives by the Chaarnaath river system in the Chaarnaath municipality in Nepal’s Dhanush district. The ecosystem restoration plan directly addresses the challenges facing around one million women and men living in both the upstream and downstream areas of Churia’s river systems. Under the project, farmer field schools are being set up in the most vulnerable areas to train both women and men farmers from community-based organizations who will, in turn, teach and train other farming households on climate-resilient agricultural techniques. These measures include learning how to reduce loss and damage from landslides by stabilizing slopes (with agroforestry, terracing, grass strips, and alley crops), and improving livestock practices (such as stall feeding and fodder banks). Added project benefits include reducing the time it takes to collect water, a burden often borne by women and girls, so that more time can be allocated to education – an essential component under Sustainable Development Goals ( SDG s) 4 and 5 to ensure inclusive quality education, and achieve gender equality. Working alongside the Government of Nepal, FAO will involve 750 community-based organizations in project activities that will strengthen women’s, men’s and indigenous peoples’ roles in land-use planning. Equal benefits for effective climate action Women’s participation in decision-making processes combined with equal access to land and resources makes for greater gender equality, improved food security and enhanced climate change adaptation and mitigation. Ultimately, climate action is a catalyst for gender equality today, and a sustainable tomorrow.

Marta learning to assemble the solar power system equipment with other Barefoot scholars. Photo credit: WFP Guatemala Polochic Valley, in northern Guatemala, enjoys year-round sunshine. But every evening, as soon as the sun sets, most people are left in the dark. Without access to electricity, their productivity, their connectivity, and, as a result, their incomes are limited. Just over half the population in this area (53.6 per cent) lives in extreme poverty – one of the highest percentages in all of Guatemala. The region’s indigenous peoples are three times more likely to experience extreme poverty compared to non-indigenous people. To cope with this lack of electricity, the predominantly indigenous population of the Alta Verapaz Department uses fires for heat and light. But this can be harmful to their health and to the environment. The JP RWEE , a joint programme to sustainably develop the livelihoods and rights of rural women, was established in 2014 to put women at the centre of rural development processes. As part of the programme’s activities in the area, and in partnership with the Government of India and Barefoot College International , two women from the region’s Tucurú municipality were selected for a six-month solar engineering course in India. From Tucurú to Tilonia Marta Benavente had never left her community before and was nervous to travel. Many people told Carmelina Botzoc not to go, saying that India was too far and six months was too long to be away from home. Despite their concerns, Marta and Carmelina embarked on their journey to Tilonia, in northern India, supported by their families and determined to make the most of this unique opportunity. Their aim: to become the first solar engineers in Tucurú and provide energy to hundreds of families in their communities. Once they arrived, they learned how to assemble, repair, and maintain solar panels, as well as manage the costs involved. Although the language barrier presented difficulties at first, their teachers overcame this using signs. “I learned how to weld, assemble, and operate lamps,” Marta says. “Even though many people told me I couldn’t do it, because technology is for men, not women, I knew I could. [The] JP RWEE taught me that women can do much more than just housework. And now my community knows that, and so do my daughters”. Carmelina’s return to her community. Photo credit: WFP Guatemala On their return, Marta and Carmelina installed solar panels in three villages, powering a hundred homes. These families can now charge their mobile phones at home, avoiding costly trips to the city. Without the need for kerosene, firewood, or candles, they have more money to spend on other things, like food. During the course, they also learned how to train other women in their community, ensuring the project’s sustainability and growth. As Carmelina says, “even though I missed my family, my people, the typical food… I knew that the effort was for me, for my family, for those women in the community to whom I was going to return to teach what I learned and, above all, so that the dream of having light in each house becomes a reality”. The JP RWEE programme is a global initiative to secure rural women's livelihoods and rights in the context of sustainable development. To date, it has assisted 80,000 participants in Ethiopia, Guatemala, Kyrgyzstan, Liberia, Nepal, Niger, and Rwanda. A new phase of the programme will commence in May 2022, and will involve Nepal, Niger, the Pacific Islands, Tanzania and Tunisia.

Hallilah mentors and supervises student trainees who have come to work in the community. Her vision is for her community to become a role model in the country. ©FAO Bittersweet is how Hallilah Nakumai sums up life in Dandan village on the east coast of Papua New Guinea’s main island, where she grew up. It was a childhood spent canoeing, fishing, weaving grass skirts and colourful bags, gardening, clearing bushes and learning about the ceremonies of her culture. But the realities of her remote, rural surroundings in the flood-prone hinterland of the mighty Sepik River were harsh. It is what motivated her to work to improve the livelihoods of people in her village. Many rural communities in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) , like Papua New Guinea, are increasingly impacted by extreme weather as a result of climate change. These island states also face geographic limitations in terms of access and trade of goods and food and generally overly rely on imports. FAO and the European Union (EU) have a particular focus on supporting SIDS in the face of these complex challenges. Giving Hallilah and her community the backing she needed after she returned to her village is just one effective example of how that’s being done. Hallilah’s journey toward leadership Hallilah’s village is 6 kilometres away from the nearest road. Therefore, the cocoa, fish and vanilla produced in the village would only reach the market late after a long walk. “Families can only buy a few basic needs and find it hard to support their children's education,” tells Hallilah.

      "article_text": "17/02/2022. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) in collaboration with the Rwanda Development Board has launched a new project to enhance the digital skills and innovation capabilities to foster agri-preneurship among youth and women in Rwanda. “This project is coming in addressing first of all the critical challenge we are having in terms of digital skills, but secondly it’s also coming to target more than 50 percent of our population which is women and youth. They are very active, they are contributing a lot in the agriculture sector and with them being educated on digital-related aspects we believe that it is going to bring a very big change in Agriculture sector and Rwanda in general,” said Diane Sayinzoga, Head of Special Economic Zones and Export Facilitation Department at Rwanda Development Board (RDB). “There is an African proverb I like. It says if you want to go fast go alone, but if you want to go far go together. In order to achieve the digital transformation, we need to work together. FAO is delighted to work with various partners and we are happy to work with Rwanda Development Board on this project,” Officer-in-Charge, Office of Innovation, Beth Crawford said. About 70 percent of Rwandans are engaged in Agriculture. The sector employs around 66 percent of the working population. The agricultural sector accounts for 26 percent of the national GDP and Young people in Rwanda constitute more than 40 percent of the entire population. However, a big percentage of young Rwandans have not yet embraced agribusiness regarding being one of the most beneficial profession. “Youth like innovations, new ways of doing things, using electronic gadgets, interacting online actually they like a business that keeps them connected. We need to make sure that we introduce all that digital approaches they prefer along the food chain, from farm to table. Therefore, if we successfully implement this project we will be immensely contributing to achieving zero hunger for present and future, Leaving No One Behind,” FAO Representative, Gualbert Gbehounou said. To educate a woman is to educate the whole family because women informally unknowingly or knowingly transfer their skills and knowledge to all members of the household. This new project targets women because hunger cannot be ended without empowering and fully involving them. The contribution of women to move a needle of the world’s development has been underrated for so long, yet they bear brunt of every dire condition a household, a family, and the world can endure. The promotion of digital skills and boosting innovation capabilities of women will greatly contribute to making their farming becomes less tiresome, rewarding, and joyous and finally increase production towards sustainable, inclusive, and resilient food systems. The project “Enhancing the digital skills and innovation capabilities to foster agri-preneurship among youth and women in Rwanda” taps and leans on the strong and fruitful partnership with the government of Rwanda through various initiatives of advancing agribusiness. Since 2017, FAO has been partnering with the Government of Rwanda in different projects aiming at digitalization of agricultural sector, bringing digital innovations to the local farmers, supporting local suppliers capacity development and promotion of E-commerce for agricultural value chains, development of the digital agricultural strategy and women and youth empowerment. The aim of these interventions are always to ensure enabling environment in embracing agricultural digitalization, bridging the gaps of digital literacy among the local farmers and increasing access to the market of the agricultural products at local, regional and international level.

      "article_text": "Ankara – Rural women provide significant contributions to agriculture and food security while simultaneously taking care of their families and households. This heavy burden often goes unrecognized and uncompensated. In addition, rural women face barriers in access to resources such as property (including land), credit, technologies, decent employment, information and skills. FAO data indicate that gender-based inequalities are largely responsible for the underperformance of the agriculture sector. To address these issues, the FAO-Turkey Partnership Programme on Food and Agriculture initiated a unique project entitled “Leaving no one behind: Harnessing Opportunities for Economic Growth through the Greater Involvement and Empowerment of Rural Women in Turkey and Central Asia”. Beginning in October 2021, the project aims to help rural women in Tajikistan, Turkey and Uzbekistan gain crucial knowledge and skills to increase the productivity of their farms, start businesses and cooperatives, and become empowered agents of change in their communities. At the same time, policymakers and practitioners will enhance capacities to formulate evidence-based, socially inclusive and gender-responsive policies in agriculture and food security – and translate these policies into action. This will be achieved through a variety of approaches including an opportunity for the ministries of agriculture of Turkey, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan to share best practices and policy solutions through a regional platform and networking opportunities. The project has a budget of USD 950 000 and will last for three years until October 2024. About the FAO-Turkey Partnership Programmes The objectives of the FAO-Turkey Partnership Programmes are to provide support to ensure food security, rural poverty reduction and sustainable forest management; combat desertification; and preserve ecosystems in Azerbaijan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkey, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, and other countries of mutual interest.

      "article_text": "Feria harvests the “Queen of Oranges”, more commonly known as the Maltese orange, in the orchards of Cap-Bon, Tunisia. ©FAO/Souha Yacoub The Maltese orange, what Tunisian locals call the “Queen of Oranges”, certainly originated in Asia, but few agree on how it arrived in Tunisia. Some say it was introduced from Spain at the beginning of the 17th century. But this doesn’t explain the appellation… Malta lies just 284 kilometers from modern Tunisia – so the orange might have been introduced directly from here. The fruit was certainly cultivated on the Mediterranean island in the 9 th century. In any case, the fruit became known as the ‘Maltese orange’ about 250 years ago and was celebrated in cookbooks, even inspiring the French sauce maltaise (a derivative sauce of Hollandaise sauce with Maltese orange juice and zest). Needless to say, the orange is highly praised in Europe and beyond. Full of benefits The Maltese orange belongs to the Rutaceae family. It resembles a half-blood orange and is cultivated most successfully today in northeastern Tunisia, specifically on the Cap-Bon peninsula, near the coast of Hammamet. It is medium in size and slightly oval-shaped with an easy-to-remove peel. Inside, the flesh is tender and juicy. Its flavor is sweet and tart, making it unique. On the tree, its orange color may turn red if exposed to too much sun. \"It is tasty and full of health benefits, especially in these times of crisis,\" says Fehria, a timid, middle-aged farmer from Cap-Bon, as she cuts the stalks off oranges. The harvesting of the Maltese orange is carried out by hand by local experts like Fehria and her colleagues. Fehria has always worked in the agricultural sector. Picking the fruits and vegetables of her region is the main source of income for her and her family. She first collected potatoes and artichokes and only began harvesting citrus fruits four years ago. Today, the “Queen of Oranges” is her focus, and she is proud to be associated with a product so exalted. The Cap-Bon region produces more than 75 percent of all citrus fruits in Tunisia. Harvesting products like the Maltese orange provides Fehria and her co-workers with a steady income. ©FAO/Souha Yacoub Maltese in name, Tunisian in production Home to around 25 000 people, Fehria’s town of Grombalia is a lively place located in Cap-Bon. The air in Grombalia is perfumed by the scent of orange flowers in spring and the golden color of the fruits light up the landscape in winter, the season of their picking. Although seasonal – from the end of December to the end of March – the picking activity provides Fehria, as well as her co-workers in nearby orchards, with a steady income and above all decent working conditions. \"Here in the orchard, surrounded by oranges, I am in my element. But what is most important to me is that my contribution is respected by my community and by my employer,\" says Fehria. The orange groves of the Cap-Bon peninsula cover an area of approximately 14 000 hectares, where roughly half of the land is devoted to the production of the Maltese orange. While the Queen of Oranges reigns in terms of exports – other local varieties, such as meski, châmi or Thomson, are also cultivated in the area. The Cap-Bon region, which produces more than 75 percent of all citrus fruits in Tunisia, also sees the propagation of mandarin and lemon trees – all taking advantage of the rich and fertile soil and year-round sunshine. Fehria ensures Maltese oranges conform to quality standards. This FAO project in Tunisia is building the capacity of food producers, quality control labs and local authorities to understand and meet the quality requirements needed for export. ©FAO/Souha Yacoub Quality and safety ensured Fehria’s boss is a producer of citrus fruits for the local market and for export. He also runs an adjoining packing station where he employs around 50 local people who wash, pack and ensure the Maltese oranges conform to quality standards. FAO supports this packing station operation, as well as other production units, to register their fruit and vegetable production with the national information system. This system helps farmers register their products for quality control and helps authorities distribute the results and accompanying licenses through this platform. Its efficiency paves the way for easier exports of fruits and other agricultural products. This is just one piece of FAO’s main activity here in Tunisia, a flagship project called Support for Official Control Services (ASCO) funded by the European Union. ASCO provides support to ensure the health of animal and plant products and aims to modernize the country’s agricultural sector through support along the value chain. This includes building the capacity of food producers, quality control labs and local authorities to understand and meet the quality requirements needed for export. Another important area of work is helping producers address and manage plant and animal diseases. Partnerships with farming communities, local authorities and the private sector are important to keep these processes working well and to allow farmers to obtain a regular income. In short, FAO helps ensure that Tunisian people have remunerative livelihoods through products like the Maltese orange, products of which they can be proud and which stand international tests of quality.

The violence had claimed several of her loved ones. The tailoring workshop she had painstakingly built up in her home city of Aleppo was no longer. She tried to carry on with the tailoring business in Turkey, working from home, but found she could only earn a paltry USD 1.50 a day. She and her husband had to borrow money to stay afloat, without any clear idea of when they’d be able to return it. They both struggled to master the Turkish language skills they needed to survive. “It took us some time to understand that market needs are different in Turkey...and realize that we must be open to learning new skills.” That’s when Tuka’s resilience and determination kicked in. She seized the opportunity to enrol in a food production and entrepreneurship skills training provided by FAO and the Turkish Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry and funded by Japan. And she’s never looked back since. Tuka learned how to stuff mussels, prepare sauces and store, pack and label foods, using equipment and packaging tools which were totally new to her. Learn more"

Women work under critical conditions using obsolete processing equipment, which expose them to occupational hazards and health challenges. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations in collaboration with the Government of Malawi through the Department of Fisheries is supporting capacity building on gender mainstreaming, targeting men and women in the fisheries value chain. This initiative is targeting fisheries extension workers, and community champions from fish processing groups and beach village committees with training on the use of one of the gender transformative approaches known as the gender household approach (HHA). Women in fisheries In Malawi, women play a crucial role in processing and marketing of fish. A recent survey in major fish markets showed that over 70 percent of the fish traders who process, transport and sell fish in wholesale markets are women. A few women own fishing gear such as seine nets and employ fishing crews to do the actual fishing while they manage from the shore. However, some women do the actual fishing especially in rivers and flood plains using hook and line and fish traps. “The household approach to gender mainstreaming is deemed ideal in the Malawi situation because as an extension approach it caters for the challenges which women in fisheries are experiencing. It empowers all adult and youth members of a household through better gender and power relations, enables equitable access to and control over resources, assets and benefits and aims to improve the livelihood of all household members indiscriminately,” Amenye Banda Fisheries Coordinator at FAO Malawi said.

      "article_text": "FAO’s Regional Office for Africa co-hosts policy and programme dialogue 23 November 2021, Accra - The ways in which crises affect men and women are shaped by intersecting vulnerabilities and social differences in socio-economic status, sex and gender identity, among others . Gender inequalities in access to and control over productive resources, services, and economic opportunities often cause women to bear a disproportionate burden of shocks. This has also been true throughout the COVID-19 pandemic, where women and girls, especially in rural and vulnerable contexts, have been more exposed to threats such as food insecurity, deprivation of education and consequently to early marriage. Governments, development agencies and civil society organisations (CSOs) face the challenge of developing and implementing gender-sensitive policies and programmes that respond to such impacts. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) recently joined efforts with the CGIAR GENDER Platform and the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) to explore gender-differentiated impacts of COVID-19 in the African region through a virtual policy dialogue. Stakeholders shared their experience and recommendations for the development of gender-sensitive programming and policymaking for building back better from COVID-19. International organizations committed to addressing challenges faced by women Abebe Haile-Gabriel, FAO Assistant Director-General and Regional Representative for Africa, opened the event with an important message on African women’s challenges in the workplace: “About 90 percent of women in Africa are employed in informal sectors, which means they are deprived of social protections. This has been strikingly evident during the COVID-19 pandemic, where more women than men have become economically inactive.” Haile-Gabriel also highlighted that such economic discrepancies are exacerbated by the gender digital divide. In Africa, only 27 percent of women have access to the internet and only 15 percent of them can afford to use it. Senior Deputy Assistant Administrator of the US Agency for International Development (USAID) Dr Maura Barry and African Union Commission (AUC) Head of Division Dr Janet Edeme echoed this message. They also underlined the reported increase in gender-based violence, child marriage and school drop-out among women and girls associated to the pandemic, re-stating USAID’s and AUC’s commitment to advancing gender equity, alongside FAO. Designing COVID-19 response initiatives: Strengthened safety nets and relief and recovery initiatives moving forward Dr Ranjitha Puskur, CGIAR Gender Platform Evidence Module Lead and International Rice Research Institute Research Leader, presented key findings from a study conducted in Ethiopia, Senegal and Zambia on gender-responsive measures in the agricultural sector to mitigate impacts of COVID-19. The study found that during the pandemic women in restrained economic situations, especially those in the informal market, suffered from food insecurity due to disrupted food supply chains and compromised income. Women in the formal sector received economic assistance in the form of tax, rent and debt-relief, but little support was provided to those in informal working positions and in agricultural settings. Food assistance and direct cash loans played an important role in helping women get though the crisis, but there were few asset support measures put in place and women were not involved in policy development. Dr Puskur highlighted a number of preventative and alleviatory measures to be adopted in future crises, including: increasing female access to finance and digital technology; investing in women’s digital literacy ; engaging women’s collectives to channel resources to rural women; equipping extension services to reach out to women during crises; engaging women in policy and decision-making processes; and investing in gender data for the strengthening of knowledge platforms. IFPRI Senior Scientist Dr Elizabeth Bryan built on these recommendations, highlighting the need to immediately address income shocks through programmes and credit schemes that target poorer rural households and asset-building programmes catered to women. Tailor-made support is essential in guaranteeing a successful recovery and in reducing the impact of shock on vulnerable groups. Three tools were underlined by Dr Nicoline de Haan, CGIAR GENDER Platform Director, to help achieve this, based on the dialogue: collecting and systematizing strong data and evidence, giving women a voice in decision-making processes, and ensuring the commitment of the international community to gender equity and women’s rights and needs.

      "article_text": "Access to water has relieved the women of the burden of collecting water far from their homes, and has increased farms production. 16 November 2021, Maseru – Women in Lesotho are primarily responsible for collecting water for home use and for farming activities. The challenge of lack or limited water infrastructure coupled with the drying of water springs have meant that they must walk further, wait for longer and rely on lower quality water to provide for their household and farming. “I used to walk a distance of 400 meters to collect water overflowing from the community storage tank. I would go there at least 20 times a day pushing a wheelbarrow especially during the dry season when the children are at school,” says Mamothepane Khatseane, a mother of four children, from Ha Koali village, Quthing district. Climate change conditions such as erratic rains and droughts have increased in her area, and she has to adapt to continue with farming, and take care of her family. In other areas, women collect water from unprotected overflow springs which provide low quality water and is shared with animals. “The spring we fetched water was a far walk. I would leave home as early as 6 a.m. to fetch water, and would return around 9 a.m. Livestock would also drink from the same spring”, says Maliile Matete, from Boluma- Tau, Mafeteng, “There were constant conflicts between women fetching water and the livestock owners,” she added. Thirsty crops and livestock Mamothepane’s husband is employed as a driver in town so he is not at home most of the day. She grows crops such as, green pepper, beetroot, green beans, spinach, fruit trees, carrots, maize, and rears pigs. During the dry season she uses a lot of water to irrigate her water thirsty crops, and provide water for her animals. “Vegetables need a lot of water. It was really tiresome, I spent a lot of time and energy collecting water, yet my family couldn’t afford a water tank. I couldn’t get time for myself,” added Mamothepane. Considering the competing uses of water, some families in the rural areas prioritize irrigating their crops and feeding livestock over other home uses such as washing. Enhancing adaptive capacity To address this, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) through the project “Strengthening Capacity for Climate Change Adaptation through Support to Integrated Watershed Management in Lesotho”, built water tanks for communities in most vulnerable livelihood zones in Mafeteng, Quthing and Thaba Tseka. According to FAO, Women are key to food production. In developing countries, women comprise 45 percent of the agricultural labour force, with that figure rising to 60 percent in parts of Africa. They bear the brunt of climate change. Investing in women creates ripple effects felt throughout entire communities. The project constructed for Mamothepane a water storage tank with a capacity of about 5 000 litres, adding to another that the government built for her. “The water tanks have reduced the work burden. During the rains I harvest water which I use. Thanks to the presence of water in my compound, I have increased the crop varieties I grow. I used to grow for home consumption, now I sell to the community around, and compliment the family’s income, I don’t have to depend on my husband for all the household needs,” said Mamothepane. She affirms that she now gets more time for herself and for her other meaningful activities like beekeeping which is earning her family income through sale of honey, and treating people with different health condition using live bee sting therapy (apitherapy). To boost her activities, the project gave her five modern beehives, two pigs, and trained her in mushroom production, and conservation agriculture, a farming technique that adapts well in the context of water scarcity.

      "article_text": "Family farming has deep roots in rural Indonesian life, but Nissa’s struggles to maintain those traditions demonstrate the threats family farmers regularly face. ©FAO/Taufany Eriz Nissa Wargadipura’s earliest memories involve learning how to live with nature. Her childhood home’s backyard in the hilly town of Garut, West Java was a little forest where her father planted vegetables, herbs and fruits. Her mother produced traditional medicine from the plants for their family and their neighbours. “Whenever I came home from school, my mother always asked me to do some “hunting,” Nissa says. The tradition of the “backyard hunt” has long been part of ethnic Sundanese life in West Java, Indonesia. “I ‘hunted’ guava, coconut, turmeric, cayenne pepper, everything. I could find all that I needed in my parent’s backyard.” Sundanese people in Nissa’s village consider their homes not only a place to rest and take shelter, but also a means to provide them food and make a living. Nissa’s idyllic memories of her Garut childhood speak to the deep roots of family farming in rural Indonesian life. But her struggles to maintain those traditions against political adversity and poverty are illustrative of the threats family farmers have faced across Indonesia. Searching for solutions Nissa was a high school student in 1989 when she first realized that her family’s livelihood—and that of other farmers in Garut—was threatened. She joined a student movement to protect the rights of local farmers and resist the government’s policy of land acquisition. Eventually, the struggle yielded results. “Finally, in 1997, around 700 farmers got their land back,” she said. The following year, Nissa and her friends established the “Pasundan Farmer Union”. The organization became one of the most influential farmers’ organizations in West Java, and today it has more than 100 000 members. Getting their land back was the first step, but it didn’t protect farmers from the ravages of poverty. Nissa experienced the desperation firsthand when she lived with a farming community at the foot of the Papandayan mountain in West Java. Farmers planted vegetables based on orders from intermediaries who controlled the city’s central market. These intermediaries provided farmers with seeds, agrochemical fertilizers and vitamins. They also encouraged farmers to move towards monoculture to reach their production targets. The high costs of the inputs increased the farmers’ dependency on the intermediaries, and when the price of vegetables dropped, farmers were left with little means of subsistence. Nissa wanted farmers to be self-sufficient and return to their traditional wisdom, so she opened a boarding school for young people to learn sustainable farming techniques. ©FAO/Taufany Eriz Not an ordinary school Nissa decided to find a way to empower the farmers, decrease their dependency on intermediaries and rekindle the experience of living close to nature. But the only way farmers and their children would regain confidence in their traditional wisdom, Nissa reasoned, was through education. In 2008, Nissa and her husband established a farmer field school called At-Thariq (meaning “the way” in Arabic) to teach agroecology, food security and religion to young people. Students also enrolled in traditional schools for formal education. Students sleep and eat at the school. They also receive sustainable farming lessons, learning mainly by doing. On only one hectare of land, Nissa designed a planting system based on intercropping, where various crops are cultivated simultaneously in the same field. The planting area is divided into several zones: a zone for tropical fruits, a fishpond in another zone and a staple food zone where they grow cassava and taro. The school also grows a variety of vegetables such as tomatoes, water spinach and herbs. Activities begin at 4 a.m. with morning prayers. After that, the high school students prepare for school, while the college seniors prepare food for breakfast and lunch and harvest the vegetables, fruit and fish that would be needed for dinner. In the afternoon, the elementary students tend the farm. In the evening, they learn more about agriculture and on the weekend, they spend all day on the farm. The school only admits 30 pupils because the farm can only feed 30 people. “Students must eat from the farms that they manage. This is one of our main lessons,” explains Nissa. Through its Family Farming Initiative, FAO supports living examples, like Nissa’s, of the values and lifestyles that concretely help the world attain a more sustainable future. ©FAO/Taufany Eriz Close to home Nunung Nurhasana spent five years at At-Thariq during high school and college. After graduating from the college of education in Garut, she returned to her village. Armed with her studies and experience from At-Thariq , Nunung applied the ideas that she learned. Nunung’s village produces a variety of fruits such as bananas, papayas and coconuts. She and the women farmers in her village process the leftover fruit into snacks and beverages, which she then promotes and sells on social media. Nunung says she spends very little on meals because, “I have everything I need in my family’s backyard.” At-Thariq has more than 1 000 alumni. Most, like Nunung, stay in their village and apply the lessons they learned. Family farming “Nissa’s journey offers some solutions to many of the challenges facing us in our efforts to create more sustainable and resilient food systems,” says Pierre Ferrand, FAO’s focal point for family farming in the Asia Pacific region. “Family farmers must be at the heart of agricultural transformation.” Family farming preserves traditional food products, contributes to a balanced diet, uses natural resources sustainably and safeguards the world’s biodiversity. Through its Family Farming Initiative as part of the Decade of Family Farming , FAO encourages living examples, like Nissa’s, of the values and lifestyles that concretely help the world attain a more sustainable future. The seeds of agricultural transformation that Nissa planted 12 years ago have started to bear fruits. And it all started in her backyard. Learn more"

This article gathers together the voices of gender experts working for the SWM Programme in Papua New Guinea, Congo and Guyana. The aim is to present their diverse experiences on effectively mainstreaming gender in project activities, and to inspire other development practitioners with the good practices they have been implementing.

      "article_text": "By coming together and forming cooperatives, smallholder farmers have found it easier to earn organic certifications, invest in new production techniques and sign contracts with companies and traders. Ninh (right) is bringing cultures together through her local farming cooperative in Viet Nam. ©FAO/ThangPham Ma Thi Ninh thought farming would be relatively easy. The Yen Duong area of Viet Nam where she lives has excellent, arable land and offers many sought-after products, including organic sticky rice, seasonal vegetables and bamboo used for traditional handicraft products. But once she started to farm and trade in local products herself, she realised that whilst harvests were generally fruitful, the earnings were few and she, and many farmers like her, remained stuck in poverty. It was only after several years that Ninh fully understood why. Local farmers were only able to sell to intermediaries and small-scale traders who offered low prices. The poor road and transport infrastructure in this mountainous, rural area also made it difficult to sell further afield or in other markets, where prices might be higher. These situations breed a cycle of low earnings that leaves farmers unable to invest in technology and innovation. It is even harder for local women to break this cycle, as they often lack opportunities to study or access the capital needed to afford technology. Cultural values The Forest and Farm Facility (FFF), hosted by FAO, and the Viet Nam National Farmers’ Union (VNFU) supported groups of farmers in forming cooperatives in the Yen Duong area. By getting organised into cooperatives, farmers can sell their products more effectively, have a joint voice to influence policy and help their members get access to basic services. The FFF seeks to strengthen these groups as primary agents of change in communities. Learn more"

From afar, she used to watch her neighbours in Kobani, Syria, through the wire mesh of the border fence. With her neighbours she shared the Kurdish language and a love for the soil.

At this point, she and her husband decided to rent a small patch of land in the village to grow vegetables.

Community seed banks help to diversify cultivation and preserve those seeds that are most adapted to local conditions. ©FAO/Telcínia Nhantumbo “Sometimes we are faced with droughts and other times we have floods,” says Anita António Candeeiro, leader of a women’s group of smallholder farmers in Chemba, Mozambique. Aside from losing food and income sources, these disasters also often wipe out fields, making it necessary for farmers to start from scratch, requiring fresh seeds to begin anew. This basic necessity, and arguably the most important part of farming, isn’t as automatic or readily available as might be assumed. Seed saving has been the answer for millennia, a practice that farmers and their families have necessarily undertaken. However, it is a skill in its own right, and knowing the proper seed storage methods is vital to ensuring that seed saving is successful. Seed storage was the weak point for Anita’s community. “We used to put them in the bags, and they would rot,” she explains. On several occasions, they even had to leave the “field empty” due to lack of seeds, comments Anita. With funding from the Austrian Development Cooperation and support from FAO, Farmer Field Schools (FFS) assisted communities to change this situation by establishing seed banks and undertaking agricultural conservation techniques.

You need to see things coming,” Hilda says. In Kenya, the unemployment rate is very high, especially among rural and female youth groups. In 2017, 22 percent of Kenyans aged 15 to 24 were unemployed.

Many of those refugees, who have been granted “temporary protection” in Turkey, work in the agri-food and livestock sectors, which offer the most opportunities in the areas where they reside. However, these opportunities are often informal and seasonal, exposing Syrians and vulnerable Turkish communities, especially women, to poor working conditions, informal employment, and low or irregular wages.

The objective was to improve the skills and economic competence of 70 mainly female Syrians and locals, in three different provinces. The main obstacles to engaging in agriculture or the microscale food industry for Syrian and Turkish agri-food workers are a lack of skills, access to credit and productive assets, as well as a limited understanding of property rights and market dynamics.

      "article_text": "FAO and the CGIAR GENDER Platform hosted a technical learning webinar focused on sharing tangible results of gender transformative approaches (GTAs) applied in the fisheries and aquaculture sectors. ©WorldFish/Chosa Mweemba On 16 March 2021, FAO and the CGIAR GENDER Platform hosted a technical learning webinar organized in the framework of the European Union-funded Rome-based Agencies Joint Programme on Gender Transformative Approaches for Food Security and Nutrition (JP GTA) . The webinar focused on sharing the tangible results of gender transformative approaches (GTAs) applied in the fisheries and aquaculture sectors. The expert panel, moderated by Susan Kaaria, Senior Gender Officer, FAO, presented specific examples of how to apply and upscale GTAs for wider impact and to achieve gender equality and food security. It was attended by more than 150 participants, underscoring the interest of development practitioners in how to integrate these approaches in their own projects and programmes. Creating the grounds for institutional commitment Ilaria Sisto, FAO’s Gender and Development Officer, welcomed participants and explained how FAO’s new Policy on Gender Equality 2020-2030 “underlines the need to go beyond ‘business as usual’ and to tackle the root causes of gender inequalities. In line with this imperative, the Policy recognizes the importance of adopting GTAs to ensure equal opportunities for all and sustainable food systems.” She also highlighted that the use of GTAs is being widely promoted in FAO’s new Strategic Framework 2022-2030 and stressed the need for continuous capacity development for staff and partners on this topic. Speaking in her role as leader of the newly-launched Working Group on GTAs of the CGIAR GENDER Platform, WorldFish Gender Research Leader Cynthia McDougall described how the Platform is facilitating collaboration between gender researchers. Running across all 14 CGIAR centres, the GENDER Platform enables researchers from a wide range of sectors to work together on generating evidence, creating methodological innovations and engaging in capacity development on the contribution of GTAs to gender equality and women’s empowerment. “Over the past decade it has become very clear, through research and M&E, that gender mainstreaming has not achieved the lasting impact we sought. That is where gender transformative approaches can make a difference and initiatives such as GENNOVATE that support the understanding of gender norms, and the design of interventions and policies, can help to address gender disparities in a more powerful way”. Presenting the JP GTA, Global Coordinator Hajnalka Petrics highlighted how “the socio-ecological model for gender transformative programming emphasizes that to achieve substantive gender equality and for norm change to be sustainable, the transformation has to happen across different scales – individual, household, community, organizations and policy – and involve multiple actors.” She also underscored the difference between GTAs and gender responsive or accommodating approaches that do not directly address the root causes of gender inequalities; in stark contrast to GTAs, which seek to understand, challenge and, ultimately, change discriminatory norms and practices to allow women to have the same opportunities as men. Starting on the right foot “I think of GTAs not as a tool or a method, or a specific approach, but rather as a process, a cycle with different phases of work,” said Steven Cole , Senior Scientist at the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture. He explained that GTAs imply the deep understanding of the norms and power relations that cause gender inequalities and gave an example on how GTAs in a small-scale capture fisheries project in the Western Province of Zambia yielded significant results to advance gender equality. Steven Cole also explained that when designing gender transformative interventions, a strong emphasis needs to be placed on using different behaviour change communication strategies, including tailor-made drama skits, to bring together a diverse stakeholder group and trigger critical reflection on gender norms. He added that setting up a robust monitoring and evaluation process to assess changes over time in attitudes, norms and behaviour, was also key. Two years into the project, the use of GTAs resulted in a significant change in gender attitudes and women’s participation in income generating activities, from processing to trading of fish. Reducing normative barriers to embrace innovation Discussing aquaculture technology projects in Bangladesh, WorldFish Senior Gender Specialist Afrina Choudhury shared insights from projects that sought to deliver new technologies to women at the homestead. Studies found that the women do not engage with new technologies in a vacuum, and there are influences from other actors and institutions. “Technology interventions that target women alone may not necessarily enhance women's contributions to agriculture outcomes nor the benefit they derive from them,” she explained. “Without social change, sustainability of impacts will also be limited. Gender power relations at every level affect the extent to which women can actually use and benefit from these innovations.” Afrina gave an example of nets that were piloted in 18 villages, designed specifically to help women catch nutrient rich smaller fish without taking much time or physical exertion. However, this new harvesting technology did not resolve the social stigma associated with catching fish, which is considered a man's job. In response, gender transformative tools were introduced to spark critical reflection and dialogue at the individual, household and community levels around the norm-related barriers that were hindering women's ability to use and benefit from this technology. As a result, men became more positive about women’s involvement in aquaculture in general, and collaboration between women and men increased. This included men helping women with fish harvesting and helping out with household work. Adopting a continuous learning approach Applying GTAs requires time commitment, passion and the belief that transformative changes are possible, along with continuous capacity building and learning by all stakeholders. Implementers can expect some form of resistance to change, particularly from institutions that have not yet made the link between their sector, gender equality and food security, underlined Steven Cole. Since social change is a lengthy process, another challenge facing organizations is the relatively short timeframe within which agricultural development projects are implemented. Audun Lem, Deputy Director for the Fisheries Division , FAO, closed the event by placing emphasis on the “strong commitment of the FAO Fisheries Division to achieve gender equality and to embed gender transformative approaches” in its technical work, as well as his “personal commitment to contribute to the gender transformative agenda”. He noted the importance of achieving gender equality to deliver greater impacts for the sustainable livelihoods of women and men involved in the fisheries and aquaculture sector and welcomed the collaboration with the JP GTA and the CGIAR GENDER Platform to “make the work of the FAO Fisheries Division even more innovative and impactful in the coming years”.

Intense rain in shorter periods of time followed by a longer dry season are the effects of climate change and ultimately result in either too much or too little water for the farmers who rely on it for their survival. Close to 90 percent of farming households in Senegal practice rain-fed agriculture. An FAO project is working to introduce both rainwater harvesting systems and innovative water management techniques that build on traditional methods. Launched in 2019, this project, called Strengthening Agricultural Adaptation (SAGA) , builds capacities to adapt to climate change, ensuring that communities, in particular women, across Senegal have regular access to water, while increasing the efficiency of its use. Garden of resilience Working with the local communities, FAO and its partners* implemented irrigation systems tailored to regional landscapes, weather patterns and the needs of the farmers. In Oudalaye village, nestled in the Ferlo sylvo-pastoral reserve in northeastern Senegal, FAO helped producers focus on traditional agroecological practices, locally called Gulle Kisnal, to reduce water evaporation. Gulle Kisnal is an agroecological water management technique where a half-moon shape is created around the plants to ensure water remains concentrated inside the mini basin and is not wasted through evaporation or run-off. Through this and other methods, the SAGA project has also helped farmers develop a thriving market garden, known locally as the “garden of resilience.” Learn more"

During his trip, Pope Francis went to areas that have been devastated by conflict, where vulnerable rural communities have struggled to survive. The governorate of Nineveh, in Northern Iraq, is among those areas once held by militants of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL). “They gave us hours to leave,\" said Dhuhaa Najm Shith, one of the many women dairy producers forced to give up their homes, farms and dreams due to the conflict. Nineveh is considered the “breadbasket” of Iraq, producing most of the country’s grain including 20-30 percent of its wheat. It is also a major centre of livestock production. The ISIL occupation of this territory between 2014 and 2017 displaced over one million people, mainly from rural areas and severely damaged the agriculture sector. \"They came back and threatened us with weapons if we didn't leave... after their insistence, we went out of the house. Me, my children and my husband's parents heading to (his brother's) house… and my husband stayed near the buffalo shed watching what happened.

It is a traditional material used to decorate yurts and make blankets and clothing. The art of making felt has been passed from one generation to the other, from mother to daughter, for centuries. “In ancient times, felt was considered a sacred material in our culture. We believed it would protect us from evil spirits and enemy forces, as well as from harsh temperatures,” says 65-year-old Zhamilya Mambetkulova, a teacher in a local school in Barskoon, located in Issyk-Kul, the most northeastern region of Kyrgyzstan. She is an expert in traditional embroidery and design and has been teaching local girls her craft for the last 40 years. In 2017, she and a group of local women came together to form an artisans’ group called Topchu, working together to produce and sell silk and felt artefacts. “We use traditional Kyrgyz motifs to create textiles, carpets, clothes, silk scarves and wall hangings adorned with felt. These are then sold at shops and boutiques in the city of Bishkek and sometimes internationally. There are currently about 15 women involved in Topchu,” Zhamilya says. Learn more"

This year’s theme, dedicated to “ Women in leadership: Achieving an equal future in a COVID-19 world ” , celebrates the tremendous efforts being made by women and girls in facing the pandemic. In all countries, women have stood at the front lines of the COVID-19 crisis, as health care workers, caregivers, innovators, community organizers, and as some of the most exemplary and effective leaders in responding to the crisis. The pandemic has highlighted the centrality of women’s contributions and the society’s reliance on their work - particularly their unpaid care and domestic work.

Those are the two main modes of transportation used by the residents of this small mountain town in the central-western region of Venezuela. A dirt road that runs through the mountains is the only connection between this remote farming town and the next largest city, Sanare, about 20 kilometres away. Coffee plants are plentiful here, but houses are very distant. It is in this town in Lara state, where Eliana Alvarado lives, with her husband Pablo Márquez, and their two sons, Santiago, who is seven, and Moisés, who is four. Eliana has just turned 30. She is in the middle of a college degree, aspiring to be a teacher, but she has worked in agriculture since she was young. “Pablo and I sow our land to feed our family. We also sell some of our produce or barter with the neighbours. Here in Caspo, we have worked with coffee for a long time, but that is a harvest that occurs only once a year. That's why we also have our small parcel of land sown with other crops,” she explains. Eliana and her family used to rely on the sale of food from their garden and on income from picking other people's crops. This only covered about 50 percent of their needs, however, and her family would rely on the government for the rest. They used all of their money just to cover their most basic necessities, principally food. Learn more"

It was meeting point of cultures and once a hub of Buddhism, but today it is more known for its majestic mountains, lush fruit orchards, ample arable land and abundant pastures. In fact, many people who live there, like Khadija Hashemi, raise sheep and goats. Whilst men do most of the farming, it is the women who take care of livestock. It tends to be a solitary activity, however, and women working together as a community is uncommon in Afghanistan. One project, the Household Food and Livelihood Security (HFLS) project funded by the Swiss Development Cooperation, aims to change this, bringing women together, boosting their knowledge and raising incomes not just for their own households, but for their whole community. The women livestock keepers participate and form bonds in group meetings, where they can exchange their views, share experiences and learn new techniques as well as keep in contact with their relatives or loved ones.

      "article_text": "Science, gender equality, and the in clusion and participation of i n digenous peoples and especially indigenous women are vital for the achievement of the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. Indigenous women are food providers, custodians of seeds, keepers of medicinal plants, and guardians of biodiversity. The indigenous traditional knowledge they hold is key for nature- based solutions in the context of climate change and sustainable development. Over the past 15 years, the global community has made a lot of effort in inspiring and engaging women and girls in science, unfortunately, indigenous women continue to face inequalities, biases, and the systematic lack of respect for their individual and collective rights that places them in situations of vulnerability. The empowerment of indigenous women is not only a central issue but also a necessary condition in order to achieve these goals. The ancestral knowledge they hold and the profound knowledge they have of their unique territories makes their contribution to science especially important. This wealth of knowledge may include the medicinal value and food use of plants, herbs, shrubs, and trees. Such knowledge is contemporary and dynamic evolving nowadays under constant pressures. indigenous women’s knowledge, activities and community roles are reliant on their relationship with Mother Earth, their territories, and natural resources. Today on the International Day of Women and Girls in Science we celebrate indigenous women and their knowledge, and we would like to highlight some indigenous women scientists and their achievements. This year’s celebration of the Day will address the theme “ Women Scientists at the forefront of the fight against COVID-19 ”, a fight in which indigenous women have played a fundamental role. Camilla Brattland is an Indigenous Sámi social scientist with an interdisciplinary background from indigenous studies and marine resource management. She specializes in research on the participation of indigenous peoples in knowledge production and resource management in Arctic and northern areas, including governance of small-scale fisheries and reindeer husbandry as an associate professor at UiT – the Arctic University of Norway. Brattland teaches bachelor and master students of community and urban planning in the fields of mixed, quantitative methods and GIS (geographical information systems). Since the outbreak of the pandemic, she has developed digital teaching materials utilising statistical data on the development of the pandemic at the world country level and the municipal level for Norway to engage and motivate social science students to study real-world phenomena using quantitative and spatial data sets. The data sets, which were developed as part of a project lead by Brattland, span the period from the outbreak of the pandemic to November 2020, and for the Norwegian municipal level it also includes variables on fisheries and coastal communities. The national and country-level data sets are published in an open research data portal ( The Stein Rokkan Research Group for Quantitative Social and Political Science (dataverse.no) where they are available to students and researchers alike, and form the basis for examples in a video series and for student exercises on the COVID-19 pandemic that have been put to use for around 200 students since the fall 2020 semester. Brattland and her team won the Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences’ “Prize of Education 2020” for the project in December 2020. She continues to apply the teaching design in new courses and expanding upon the data sets as students engage in gathering statistics on the development of the COVID-19 pandemic as part of university courses and their own student projects . “Indigenous women in science will utilize science to the benefit of indigenous communities & pass on scientific literacy to their children, thus contributing to the sustainability & literacy capacity of indigenous communities in general” - Camilla Brattland. Guriwun Torres Zalabata is an indigenous woman and biologist from the Arhuaco People of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta in Colombia.Torres Zalabata graduated from the National University of Colombia, later enrolling in a Master's Degree in Biology Science s at the same university.

In response to COVID-19, she has promoted within their communities to revitalize their traditional practices resorting to natural medicine and sacred plants, strengthen the Arhuaco's food system, and boost the Arhuaco's cultural principles as the only avenue to ensure the survival of her people but also of humanity. “The value of our engagement in science lies in our crucial contribution generating new knowledge based on ancestral knowledge that responds to indigenous peoples' realities and interests. I believe this knowledge process forges a bridge of understanding between sicence and indigenous peoples' scientific views. My elders' teachings help me better understand modern societies’ science, enabling me to apply both approaches for my people's welfare. I believe our contribution to science enhances visibility, increasing our participation and leadership in decision-making processes” - Guriwun Torres Zalabata Hindou Oumarou Ibrahim is an expert in the adaptation and mitigation of indigenous peoples to climate change.

Many have been killed or displaced, fleeing to avoid the fighting. Others, like 66-year-old Fiya Hassan and her family, lost their homes and livelihoods. Fiya’s house was burned down during armed clashes, but she couldn’t bear to leave her homeland: the memories of happier times, with her children growing up in her backyard were just too strong. Instead, she and her family rebuilt the destroyed parts of their house and decided to stay, hoping for a better future. Fiya is the head of her household and a grandmother of eight, living in the Ibtaa sub-district in southwest Syria. She had always relied on farming to generate a proper income, as well as provide food for her family. But since the conflict started in 2011, obtaining the necessary agricultural inputs has become increasingly tough due to the ongoing violence, the economic crisis and the fluctuating currency rate. These problems have prevented thousands of farmers like Fiya from being able to sustain their livelihoods. A solution in small-scale farming According to the Humanitarian Needs Overview 2019 , more than 9.3 million people in Syria are food insecure.

This difficulty— in addition to other problems like unexploded ordnance in some fields, high transport costs and limited marketing opportunities— means that farmers have not been able to provide for themselves, and many rely on food distribution to meet their daily needs. Responding to this, FAO, with the financial contribution of Kuwait, has provided 3 000 rural families in the Daraa and As-Suwaida governorates with seasonal vegetable seedlings, fertilisers and tools to begin farming again.

      "article_text": "Since 2015, FAO participated in the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence campaigns in Kyrgyzstan, Georgia, and Turkey. Samira lives in a very remote village in Kyrgyzstan with her husband and four children. They grow vegetables in a small greenhouse to feed the family. In addition, Samira works at the bakery with 10 other women – they bake bread for the local school. This might sound like “a typical life” in a rural setting, but their life was not like this before. Samira’s husband, Amir, is a farmer, but for the last three years he has not been successful with the agricultural land he rents. Their area is severely affected by climate change. Sudden water shortages and unusual dryness have burned the crops and the family has barely been able to feed themselves during the last few winters. Many people, especially young people, have already left. Amir, under societal pressure to provide for the family, lost all hope. It was not possible to move out and seek better opportunities due to a lack of financial means. Gradually, he started to drink heavily. “These were difficult times,” Samira recollects. “I did not know what to do and all I could do was asking for help from my parents. When Amir found out, he became furious. My children and I were shouted at often. It was really scary. And what could I do? All I knew was a regular “women’s” routine: to bring water, cook, clean the house, and look after the children. When there were possibilities, I helped my husband in the field, while our kids were at school.\" Learn more"

According to João, these materials and the knowledge previously acquired in the Field School trainings were essential for him and the group to recover from Cyclone Idai’s damages. “After Idai, FAO did not forget us. We received seeds and restarted farming activities,” states João. With this help, João managed to produce enough for his family and sell part of the harvest. Using the money from these sales, he bought and planted cabbage seeds, taking advantage of the high demand for the vegetable in local markets. Learn more"

Up until 2018, both Apande and her fellow community member and friend, Agok, farmed on their own, but their farming knowledge was limited and with such difficult farming conditions, the food grown was never enough. This is an area that also struggles with conflict and violence, making it hard for farmers to access markets. In fact, only 31 percent of households in the Lakes State have access to food year-round. When Apande and Agok heard about a nearby farming group, established through the ‘Sustainable Agriculture for Economic Resiliency’ project, run by FAO and funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), they decided to join.

Job opportunities are scarce for the residents here. They are people who fled from war, constant insecurity or hunger, but it’s not easy to create a good life for themselves in this new region either. Fartun arrived to Bossaso from southern Somalia a “long time ago”, but she doesn’t remember when. A mother of four, she used to stay at home to look after their children, while her husband, earning little, worked as a porter in the market of Bossaso. She and her husband struggled to provide for themselves and their children. But a few months ago, Fartun learned about a new opportunity in her community. She enrolled in an innovative FAO project, funded by the government of Kuwait, to learn how to make a specialty more synonymous with Italy than Eastern Africa: pasta. Not just any kind of pasta, however, fish pasta. Perhaps not widely known, but pasta is actually a common meal in Somalia, part of the legacy from its time as an Italian colony. What isn’t a common meal in Somalia, at least not yet, is fish, particularly in the country’s inland communities. “I wanted to somehow earn some income for my family,” says Fartun. Learn more"

      "article_text": "26 May 2020, Washington, DC/ Ottawa, ON - The COVID-19 pandemic will have significant medium- and long-term impacts on global food and nutrition security, livelihoods, climate resilience, gender equality, trade, and social stability. In order to share Canadian perspectives on the response to the anticipated impact of the pandemic on food security and nutrition, FAO North America and CARE Canada co-hosted a webinar moderated by Gregory Spira, Head of Food Systems and Resilience Programs, CARE Canada. “COVID-19 is far more than a health crisis, and affects women and men differently,” said Jessie Thomson, Vice President, International Programs at CARE Canada who launched the discussion. She highlighted the latest CARE Policy Brief, COVID19, Food & Nutrition Security, and Gender Equality , which warns that women are more susceptible to the food security and nutrition impacts of COVID-19 as women and girls already make up 60 percent of hungry people and 76 percent of displaced people worldwide. “Over the years, Canada has played an extremely important role within FAO. We have strongly valued its leadership and support always and especially today when the world navigates in such turbulent waters,” said Vimlendra Sharan, Director of FAO North America in his welcoming remarks. “The combination of COVID-19 and lockdowns could drive up to 420 million people into absolute poverty,” warned Sharan. “Given the intrinsic link between poverty, food security and nutrition, governments must initiate immediate action as even short-term disruptions in provisioning adequate and nutritious food could have long-lasting impacts on survival, health and development.” The Hon. Mike Lake, Member of Parliament for Edmonton-Wetaskiwin and Conservative Shadow Minister for International Development joined the webinar and called upon Parliamentarians to find common ground to address the challenges of poverty and food insecurity, in Canada and abroad. He also emphasized that sharing success stories of international development is key to helping governments create initiatives like the G8 Muskoka Initiative for Maternal, Newborn and Child Health. Rene Vanderpoel, Chief of Party, CARE Honduras stated that “what started as a health crisis is becoming a food and existential crisis,” especially for coffee farmers in Honduras who are now cash strapped and cannot afford inputs to maintain their land to ensure a good harvest next year. He added that women are also more likely to have less access to inputs. CARE Honduras, supported by Global Affairs Canada, is currently working to provide women coffee farmers in Honduras with inputs. FAO’s Chief Economist and Assistant Director-General Máximo Torero Cullen outlined the impacts of COVID-19 on the economy and food systems. He explained that the economic recovery would be slower than anticipated. Food processing, distribution, and service are sectors most impacted by the health pandemic. He highlighted the importance of creating new markets so that small businesses have liquidity, can safeguard food safety, and minimize food loss and waste. Claude Beausejour, Director General of the Food Systems and Environment Bureau at Global Affairs Canada, highlighted how the agency, in close coordination with the Rome-based Agencies, such as FAO, is prioritizing “small island developing states and vulnerable countries, where food access and loss of livelihoods are the main challenges. These problems are likely to increase rates of malnutrition.” “Many policies are still gender blind or neutral,” said Dr. Silvia Sarapura, Assistant Professor, School of Environmental Design and Rural Development, University of Guelph. She added that feminist and gender research planning is needed to enhance agri-food systems, as women are key contributors to food systems, food security and biodiversity management. She also noted that the pandemic is worsening existing gender inequalities. “The health crisis provoked a drastic drop in solvent demand which has led to significant production surpluses and a drop in producers’ income,” said Hugo Beauregard-Langelier, Agricultural Economist and Secretary-General of UPA Développement International. He added that future strategies should “ensure greater food autonomy via the introduction of the concept of reciprocity in commercial exchanges and trade, adjust risk management mechanisms, and support family and local entrepreneurship.” “Half of First Nations and Inuit populations are food insecure,” said Gisele Yasmeen, Executive Director of Food Secure Canada as she underscored that factors such as inequality and poverty can make people more susceptible to the impacts of COVID-19. She outlined that building resilient local food systems will require supporting small and agro-ecological producers, providing decent work, and supporting Indigenous food sovereignty and self-determination. Virginie Levasseur, Director of Programs of Africa, SOCODEVI, and Co-Chair of the Food Security Policy Group (FSPG) in Canada, shared the FSPG’s call for food assistance and safety nets, prevention of transmission of the virus, resilience in food value chains, gender equality, women empowerment, and youth engagement in building back from COVID-19. “Without food, there is no health and without women, there is no food,” said Jessie Thomson of CARE Canada as she summarized key takeaway messages from the speakers. The session highlighted that COVID-19 will affect vulnerable populations the most, amplifying existing inequalities and challenges caused by climate change, among other issues. She emphasized the need to address the root drivers of food insecurity and build back inclusive food systems that are socially, economically and environmentally sound.

      "article_text": "Three women farmers saw an opportunity to further their knowledge and benefits from farming when the FAO project “Dynamic Conservation and Sustainable Use of Agrobiodiversity in Traditional Agroecosystems of the Philippines” came to their community. The Luhib women farmer-leader trio: Juanita Celiz, Candelaria Dumale, and Merlinda Go. In a province in the southern Philippines, three elderly women farmers are proving that not only are women indispensable contributors to agriculture and the economy but also that gender and age are not -- and should not be -- hindrances to pursuing a better life for yourself and your community. Juanita Celiz, 49, Candelaria Dumale, 65, and Merlinda Go, 52, tend to vegetables that they are raising in gardens for home consumption and for selling. “ Sarili mong tanim, alam mong safe kainin [You know the food is safe if you plant it yourself],” says Merlinda. The three elderly women from Barangay Luhib in Lake Sebu in South Cotabato are active advocates of healthy eating and of farming. And although they admit that their years are rapidly advancing, they do not use age as an excuse to slow down. In fact, they see their “senior years” as motivation to better their lives as well as those of their fellow women farmers in their community. This is laudable particularly in the light that many agriculture-based countries – including the Philippines – still look at women as no more than farm assistants. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) reports that, sadly, women farmers’ contribution to food production remains “ undervalued if not invisible ”. The three friends, however, says that they have not always known about the benefits of growing their own vegetables. A few years back, Juanita, Candelaria, and Merlinda, along with other women members of their barangay (village), attended training on proper nutrition provided by an NGO. It is during one of the training sessions that they realized they were unwittingly ingesting harmful substances from the food they bought from the market. “ Wala akong kamalay-malay na nilalason ko na pala ang sarili ko [I was not aware that I was poisoning myself],” says Merlinda. She was referring to pesticide-laced vegetables and other food products that are sold in public markets. “ Doon na lang ako sa traditional at sarili naming tanim. Siguradong safe na, puwede pa pagkakitaan [I will just stick with traditional and home-grown crops. They’re not just safe, I can earn from them as well],” she adds. Learn more"

Many of them are engaged in agricultural labour and micro-scale food businesses to make their living. However, most of these opportunities are informal and seasonal, which often expose them to poor working conditions and low and irregular wages. This can also lead to lower wages for workers in local communities who are hosting them, fueling competition and social tensions. Limited access for women to property, equipment, and entrepreneurship opportunities is a significant challenge to starting their own businesses. FAO conducted market assessments and identified agrifood products which have strong and stable consumer demand in local markets. In close collaboration with local stakeholders, FAO assessed the feasibility of small-scale joint production cooperatives by Syrians and Turkish women. Cooperatives by and for women can offer particular opportunities for them to control their own economic activities, especially in situations where women face social and cultural constraints. Based on the assessment, in March last year, FAO launched the project “Promoting self-reliant livelihoods of Syrian refugee and Turkish host communities through entrepreneurship in food and agriculture” in Izmir, Sanliurfa, and Mardin provinces with financial support from Japan.

Inception workshop The inception workshop for \"Empowering women in fisheries for sustainable food systems\" was convened in Accra, Ghana, on 3-5 March 2020 and brought together some 45 participants, including country teams consisting of government representatives, women in small-scale fisheries associations, and FAO focal points. Representatives from regional organizations, the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad) , FAO headquarters and other partners were also present. Learn more"

Women comprise about 43 percent of the agricultural labor force, but even more of its potential. Inclusive rural transformation means creating more employment opportunities for women, both on and off the farm. ©FAO/Mohammad Rakibul Hasan For billions of people around the world, rural transformation means new opportunities. Greater access to knowledge and tools means more productive farming, while greater productivity on the farm means more resources for education, health and other activities. Through rural transformation, rural people can drive economic growth, fight hunger and lift their own communities out of poverty. To realize this potential, however, rural transformation needs to be inclusive. As it stands, women – and especially young women – are unable to take advantage of all the opportunities that rural transformation can provide. With less education, fewer job opportunities and more restrictive cultural expectations, young rural women typically face additional barriers that other people in poverty do not. Unless policies address these disparities, rural transformation runs the risk of continuing to overlook the needs of young rural women – and leaving women further behind. Because of the pre-existing challenges that young rural women face, inclusive rural transformation won’t just happen naturally. Rather, we need to make it happen.

Since the crisis, the cost of figs is so low that it doesn’t cover the cost of production. ©FAO/Jafaar Merie Since 2011, the Syrian conflict has hard hit the families in the country. Family members have been lost, homes and belongings left behind. Food and agriculture practices passed on for generations have been abandoned. Even the ties to home towns, villages, traditions and history have been broken. Women often bear the brunt of this disruption. For Adla Hasan, for example, when her olive trees stopped producing fruits, it wasn’t just the loss of her livelihood, it was losing a part of her family history. “I make olive products because these are the products which were made for years by my parents and my grandparents. I love my job,” she discloses. Adla is from Safita, Tartous in the northwestern part of Syria, just north of Lebanon. This is olive-growing country, the Mediterranean climate perfectly suited for the robust trees and their precious fruit. Before the crisis, Adla’s family could live off of their olive production. Now all the money that she makes goes to providing for their daily needs. She has none left to spend on her farm – on fertilizer, irrigation, pruning – so the trees aren’t producing anymore.

Her house runs on solar power. The water is fetched from a nearby stream. Her food is homegrown. Her surroundings - the mountain ridges of Biogradska Gora National Park with its sprawling pine forests, rolling meadows, pristine streams and glacial lakes - exude an air of a world untouched. But life can get tough here. Smallholder farmers like Danka used to rely heavily on agriculture. So much so, that a bad blueberry harvest or honey season could be enough to put their livelihoods at risk. Opportunities were scarce, and young people moved or were tempted to move elsewhere. But with help from FAO and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) , opportunities started opening up. Some 100 smallholder farmers from mountain villages in northern Montenegro are now reaping the benefits of agro-tourism and/or getting recognition for preserving centuries-old culinary traditions, and a way of life that, elsewhere, has been long abandoned or is slowing dying out. Left: Maya Kljajić, one of the farmers who benefitted from the agro-tourism initiative, preparing food for her guests. Right: Tourists sample local cheese, dried meat, home-baked bread and brandy. ©EBRD-FAO/Dermot Doorly 30-year-old Danka hosts tourists, mostly from other parts of Europe, in “katuns” – centuries-old wooden huts used in the past by nomadic herders. She offers them guided hiking and horse riding, lessons in cheese making, and enthralls them with fresh, organic food. “We have organic food, always organic. We have blueberries, mushrooms, actually everything. We do not buy anything at the market. That’s the best because we make the food with our hands and we know how it’s made. And it’s very delicious for tourists,” says Danka. “This is the first year of the tourist season, and it’s a very good season. July was completely full with guests. I did not expect so many guests…My life changed a lot. I have maybe to work more and harder, but it’s very nice because I meet different people and can earn money,” she adds. The FAO-EBRD project staff has worked with ministries, non-governmental organisations, tourism agencies, hotels and restaurants in Danka’s area and nearby municipalities to promote agro-tourism and local, high quality foods. Through the project, farmers got connected with restaurant and hotel owners; and farmers and chefs got trained in how to store and cook local products so that their unique quality was enhanced and food safety compliances were met - all with the aim of encouraging locals to keep their traditions alive whilst boosting their incomes. Produced mainly by women, Kolasin Lisnati sir (layered cheese) is one of the newest GI-labelled foods in northern Montenegro. ©EBRD-FAO/Dermot Doorly “Serving traditional dishes directly supports the farmers. Our potatoes, veal, fruits, vegetables and dairy products are all sourced from the local farmers,” says restaurant owner Plana Pejović who took part in the FAO-EBRD training. A typical lunch at her Serdar Restaurant near Mojkovac would consist of fresh cream cheese and creamy mushroom soup served with potatoes and cheese. At the entrance, the restaurant also sells blueberry juice, honey and other local products to visitors. Elsewhere in northern Montenegro, FAO and EBRD, with funding from Luxembourg, helped farmers get international recognition - Geographical Indication (GI) status - for some of their foods thanks to their high quality and unique production process. Crnogorska Goveđa pršuta (Montenegrin dried beef meat) and Crnogorska Stelja (Montenegrin dried and smoked sheep meat) received GI status in 2018. Inspired by the project, five additional products have been registered as GI, including Kolasin Lisnati sir (layered cheese), which is produced mainly by women. To get the GI certification, the project staff worked with farmers, food processors and local authorities to help them upgrade their products’ food safety and quality standards. This included helping producers develop and agree on a code of practice that they must respect in order to sell their products under the GI label – for example, the food must come from the designated areas, and high quality and hygiene standards must be upheld. The project has also supported policy dialogue and development of appropriate food safety standards in the meat sector at the national level, and raised producers’ and consumers’ awareness about the new standards. The GI-labelled dried beef, for example, must be made from the best cuts of fresh beef fed mostly on grass, salted with sea salt, beechwood-smoked and dried in the mountain air. This gives the meat its distinctive dark plum colour, consistency and texture and prevents any bitter taste. “I have been involved in meat production – beef prosciutto and sheep meat – from an early age because my ancestors, my grandfather and grandmother were also doing this,” says meat producer, Almir Aldrović. “I’m very excited about receiving the GI certification because this will give us new opportunities, open new markets and businesses,” he adds. By supporting local traditions to build better livelihoods and empower communities, FAO and its partners are working toward a world free of poverty and hunger. Learn more"

      "article_text": "We were taught how to make apple and orange jam by using simple techniques, which will work for rural women,” said Razan, who will later visit other governorates, such as Lattakia, Rural Damascus and Hama to train rural women. The crisis in Syria has left increasing numbers of women as the sole breadwinners and heads of their households. In rural areas, employment opportunities for women are limited. One way rural women can boost their livelihoods is to process food for sale by building small-scale businesses, either independently or with their neighbours. Each governorate has unique ways of making jams, pickles, pepper molasses and other authentic Syrian foods . These foods are seen as essential for every Syrian house, and “homemade” is widely considered best. Selling homemade foods provides a good business opportunity, however, the challenge of generating an income from selling these foods and reaching a wider, local market is producing a large quantity in a systematic way, while maintaining traditions and respecting food standards. FAO recognized the need to train rural women on key success factors in selling food products , namely production standards, branding, marketing and bookkeeping to ensure that rural women can earn a profit from processing food. With support from the Government of Japan , FAO offered intensive training programmes on food processing for female technicians as part of the “Women’s empowerment” project. Women technicians will then pass their knowledge on to vulnerable, rural women. Women’s enrolment in these programmes will give them access to resources and knowledge, as well as improve their skills and capabilities. The FAO training courses on standardized food processing practices has encouraged young female technicians employed at the Rural Women Empowerment Department (RWED) to enhance their technical knowledge on food production. Razan Al Khoury, a 27-year-old technician at RWED, attended the training that took place at the Faculty of Agriculture at Damascus University. “We were trained on food production and standards to support rural women. We were taught how to make apple and orange jam by using simple techniques, which will work for rural women,” said Razan, who will later visit other governorates, such as Lattakia, Rural Damascus and Hama to train rural women.

Mushtari Hesari explaining hygienic food production practices to women in her community. ©FAO/Azizyar “Now not only have I managed to support my family economically but I have also gained many life skills that have assisted me to generate an income, educate my children and help them have a better future,” says Mushtari Hesari, a mother of four children living in the Parwan province of Afghanistan. She believes that if she can be a self-sufficient woman, others can be too. While women are equal in number to men in Afghanistan, their participation in socio-economic affairs is negligible. Women are not fully involved in many issues due to cultural norms, lack of literacy and education on certain socio-economic topics. Mushtari believes that if better opportunities are provided to women, they can provide considerable support to a household’s economy. Mushtari lives in a place where women are rarely involved in making decisions about their life and their future. Economically, they are very dependent on the male members of the family. However, as an educated woman who graduated from the faculty of literacy, Mushtari always thought of improving the lives and livelihoods of the women in her community. This led her to take the next step and do something for the women in her community. Learn more"

Through trainings for farmers and young people, Hassan demonstrates that beekeeping can be profitable and provide a sustainable livelihood. ©FAO/Erastus Mbugua. Hassan Muhumed Abdilaahi waves from the small green tuk-tuk that has brought him from home to his beloved and ever-growing apiary. Having expanded his business from two hives in 2013 to 150 today, the beekeeper has good reason to smile. His friends describe him as “born with a bee” — a local saying for someone who is very knowledgeable and passionate about something. Originally from the Gebiley district in Somaliland, Hassan started his journey into beekeeping at the age of 24. His breakthrough came in 2014 when he attended a beekeeping training conducted by FAO under a project funded by the United Kingdom through the Sustainable Employment and Economic Development (SEED) Programme. “That changed my life,” said Hassan. “After the training, they provided us with two modern hives and a complete beekeeping start-up kit, with a beekeeping suit, smokers, knives and brushes.” The results have been dramatic. He now produces over 2 000 kilograms of honey each year, up from the 30 kilograms he produced in 2013. Importantly, although recurrent droughts in the area can disrupt his activities, Hassan can also sufficiently maintain his bees’ production. Learn more"

Women prepare feed for their chickens in the Comoros. ©FAO/Jobert Tchuidjang The Union of Comoros, or the Comoros, is an archipelago of volcanic islands off the south-east coast of Africa. It boasts blissful weather, swaying palm trees and clear waters. But it is also one of the world's poorest nations, hampered by few natural resources, high dependence on imported food, and the constant threat of natural disasters. The consequences are stark. The Comoros imports about 70 percent of its food, and the import rate of some foods, such as poultry, is as high as 90 percent. Half of the population – about half a million people - do not have enough to eat, and malnutrition rates are amongst the highest in the world. To address this, one area identified by the Government of Comoros and FAO in 2017 to improve people’s access to home-grown, nutritious food as well as boost their income was the poultry sector. Since then, FAO and its partners have been working with some 400 farmers – about half of them women, and nearly three quarters of them young people - to set up poultry groups and over 250 henhouses. They provided them with 16 solar-powered incubators (on 12 sites) and five chickens per person, and trained some 450 people – farmers and government workers - in raising poultry. FAO has also provided vaccination services. Learn more"

The two organizations have teamed up to enhance the skills of small-scale women food producers from Syria - all with the aim of supporting crisis-affected communities to regain or boost their livelihoods, and reviving the country's agriculture sector. Seven Syrian women will learn from farming communities in Piedmont and Liguria regions that produce and promote local, organic and artisan foods marked by high quality and respect for traditions. They are expected to gain knowledge on all aspects of production, marketing and value chains of a range of products - including dairy, honey, oil, cereals, breads and vegetables - and to pass on this knowledge to other women farmers in their communities upon their return. They will also be included in the global Slow Food network of local farmers so that they can continue learning and sharing knowledge and experiences. The Syrian women come from Homs, Hama, Lattakia, Tartous, Aleppo, Sweida and Al Qunatra governorates, and are each engaged in producing one type of local food - one product per each village - from dried figs to honey. They either own a small plot of land (less than half hectare), growing food for their family's consumption and/or are engaged in activities such as making jams, pickles, tomato paste, cheese and other food products to support their families.
